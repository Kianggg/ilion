<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
HIIIII my name is Doudou, nice to meet ya! Hmm, a lil' bit about me... Um... I'm almost 3 years old, and I like to play a lot, and make friends, and now I'm part of Ilion! Yeah, that's right, hehe! <em>(proud smirk)</em> I also love to eat... Is that a sammich in your pocket...?

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
WAOOWW I'm so happy to be a part of Ilion! I'm very proud because now I am strong, I can run very fast, and my brothers and sisters can't make fun of me anymore, hehe! Look! <em>(Flexes muscles)</em> See?

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
I LIKE RUNNING! RUNNING, YAYYYYYYYY! RUN! FAST! FAST!!!

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
When I get tired... zzzzzz... When I'm done running, I just want to plop on the floor! <em>SNOREE</em>

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
I get nervous sometimes... I think because I was always the baby at home, it's hard for me to believe in myself... But I know I have the bestest team with me and we all work as hard as we can to pull the sled together!!!

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
I think about my owner mommy back home... She's the one who saw the spark in me! I want to be the best sled dog to make her proud! ^w^

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
<em>(Tummy growls)</em> My hobby is... big steak! <em>(Licks lips)</em> Oh, and broccoli, and sashimi, and chewing on big bones and-- <em>(He continues to list every food that comes to mind.)</em>

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
I'm wide awake the moment the other dogs are up, and I follow them wherever they're going, no matter what they're doing! I have to follow DA BEST to BE DA BEST!!!

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
I think my fave country so far has been Germany! When we visited the restaurants, we got big sausages that were so, so, SO YUMMY!! I could have eaten those all day, yum yum!!!

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
Um... I would want to go back home to Wisconsin and see Mama Poodle, Miss Owner, Daddy Sammy, and my brothers and sisters... Because I miss them a lot... 

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I WANT TO BE THE BEST SLED DOGGY EVER!!! And help my team be DA BEST IN DA WORLD!!!!!

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
I think they should add more meals during the day... and extra snacks... and more food in our bowls hehe...

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
NO!!! I THINK THEY ARE THE BEST ALREADY!!! I LUV THEM!!! YAYYY!!!!!

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
BALTO!!! He ran so fast, and he's my hero... I watched his movie with Mama Poodle and Miss Owner when I was younger and he was just so cool...!

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
GRRRRRR <em>(growls)</em> Don't think you can beat us! >:0 WE R DA BEST!!!

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Can I have your sammich please...
