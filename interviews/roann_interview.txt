<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
It's Roann. I'm swing position on the sprint team.

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
It's been the most fun I've had in years. I sorta expected everyone to be afraid of me, but I've been treated with nothin' but kindness... A lil' too much sometimes, maybe...

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
'Course I like runnin'... But that feelin' of my teammates and I pullin' Musher together as one big unit is unbeatable. I used to be such a lil' thing; barely moved a muscle! Now I actually have em'!

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
My fur gettin' in the way... BUT I don't need a cut or anything!

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
My furs the only thing that bothers me... Everyone be sayin' "Roann get a cut!" Well what if I don't wanna! I have it all under control... 
<em>(She's shaking the frizzier strands away.)</em>

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
The sanctuary itself I'd say. I was in a really terrible place before I came here... Musher and Ilion saved me, so I want to win as much as possible so that Ilion Sanctuary can grow even further.

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
Everyone knows I like runnin' around; I really can't stay in one place too long. But other than that, I love watching movies. No preference as long as nobody's bein' noisy during 'em =_=;

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
A trip to the Cafe is a must... I'm always tryin' somethin' different on the menu-- d-do you wanna go?

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
The weather took some gettin' used to, but of course I'm pickin' Alaska! My sanctuary's here! I actually start to feel a little homesick sometimes during travel.

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
I've already been all over so... No, not really. No place compares to Ilion anyways.

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
Hmm... I dunno... Maybe write my memoir... OH! I-I want to see Ilion become famous enough to get a block buster movie starring Musher!

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
...By that point Illion would have enough money to build a theater... Slap that thing right by the cafe...! And- and then an indoor pool!
<em>(She's rambling on to herself.)</em>

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
Although I've been told... Many times. "There's always somethin' to be improved upon"-  Yatta yatta...
<em>(She speaks quietly.)</em>
What Musher has done and continues to do is always more than enough, and amazin' too, might I add.

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
Well, I'll have to watch Togo's film first, though from the stories I've heard, he was clearly the better dog.

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Hmm... Nice knowing you? 
<em>(Smug.)</em>

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Um, please sponsor Ilion Sanctuary so we can build an indoor pool and a theater.
