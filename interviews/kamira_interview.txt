<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Yo! My name is Kamira and I'm a fashionista jersey gal!~ ૮୨୧ ＾ﻌ＾)ა
I’m here for your sewing, pictures, and fashion needs, so don't be shy to ask any questions! And remember, I'm not just a pretty face on the starting line! ૮ >ﻌ♡ა

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
I just love love LOVE it here!!  ૮ ♡ﻌ♡ა
Even though I'm a model, I'm actually quite shy... ૮ ◞ ﻌ ◟ ა
I was so nervous since it's such a big environment change from modeling, but the Musher and everyone has been so kind and accepting!!
<em>(She picks up the wood heart carving to show to the interviewer.)</em>
That's why I wear this lil' heart sash on racing days! My first bestie gave it to me when I first came here, and I was just so grateful for everyone being so nice to me, so it's a little reminder of that, hehe... ૮ ̷ ̷ ̷・ﻌ  ̷ ̷・ ა

So as you can see, all the kindness I got quickly made me come out of my hidey hole!! It makes me giggle when people say it's been such a big change from how I was when I first came, to how I am now. Which... I can say is true... but I did say I'm quite shy!! ૮( •́ .̫ •̀ U)
But warming up to everyone, getting into the groove of a new routine, making some new besties, it just feels like home now! 
Plus, the booze here is really good~ 
*Ehhh.. Was I not supposed to say that..? ૮( ´⁰▱๋⁰` )ა *

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
I just LOVE the rush of it all!!! ૮(✪⋏✪)ʋ
I used to run in the big open fields in the woods in Jersey, so having the chance to do that all the time? It just makes me... 
<em>(She does a little dance.)</em>
...sooo happy!! I know I used to be a model, but sometimes a girl just wants to get down and dirty!!! ૮(•̀ꐧ•́)ა

And when we get 1st place? Just... 
<em>(There's a dreamy look behind her bangs.)</em>
Oh, there's nothing quite like it... Hearing my friends cheers and laughter from getting the gold is just music to my ears, that I wanna listen to on repeat over and over again. Ah... got a little sappy there, but it makes me so happy to have moments like that with my friends, heh. ໒( = ᴥ =)ʋ 

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
My nails breaking. 
<em>("I-is that really it..?")</em>
Yes.

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
Sometimes...! It’s such a big change from modeling to, ya know, running through thick snow and my lungs about to burst from the cold air hehe. So I do get a bit nervous about my performance... ૮( •́ .̫ •̀ U)

But making new besties and learning the ropes helped soooo much! I start getting caught up in the rush too hehe. Once the goggles go on, the Jersey comes out!!! 
*Maybe a LITTLE too much but it helps pump me up ahehe.. ໒( = ᴥ =)ʋ*

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
To have the feeling of the adrenaline in my veins, my heart pumping so hard I hear it in my ears, the snow blowing into my bangs-- get it? 'Cause you can't see my eyes hehe-- and just hearing everyone breathe in a hardworking unison... so exhilarating! ૮(✪⋏✪)ა

You know how in the movies, time slows down, with the main character just looking around at their friends and a big ole smile goes across their face? That's what I'm chasing for every race. To be alongside my friends and rushing for the gold, what more could a gal ask for? <3 
*O-ok I'm getting too sappy here, onto the next question!! ૮( ¯͒▱๋¯͒ )ა*

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
I'm a fashion gal so of course I have to know how to sew! Clothes aren't cheap nowadays ya know!!! ૮(•̀ꐧ•́)ა
Besides making or fixing up some clothes, I like to sew plushies too! I try to make gifts for friends if I have the time! ૮ ᴖﻌᴖა
I do nail art as well even though I can't wear them in races. I still sport a lil' bit of color on my nails! I run a blog too and post about whatever the team or I am doing. Plus, it's great promo for the team, hehe. ໒( = ᴥ =)ʋ

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
Ok, so my fluffy fluffy hair needs LOTS of taking care of. ໒(ŏᆺŏU)
So I first start off with taking my hair out of my hair wraps, but you know, since I've been sleeping on it all night it’s gonna be a bit flat, right? So I mist my hair with some water mixed with leave-in conditioner to make it nice and moisturized with a nice sweet scent! Then I fluff it out nice and big! ໒( = ᴥ =)ʋ
You know, when I have to wash it, it's suchhhh a process. I usually have to detangle and then shampoo which takes HOURS sometimes, then I have to deep condition it for at least an hour. THEN- 
<em>("Ah, I think we're getting a bit off course here...")</em>
Oh right ahehe.... I tend to ramble on sometimes, sowwy.. ᘳ´• ᴥ •`ᘰ

So... I get up to do my hair and then head out to the dining hall while checking my phone for any new updates on my socials! ૮ ᴖﻌᴖა
I try to wake up early to the best I can so I can try to do a little bit of exercise. A model and a racer has to stay in top performance times two!! ૮(•̀ꐧ•́)ა
I make some meat slop for the morning as I like to add my own little *~*pizazz*~* 
*Ah, whoopsie...! I swear it fits our diet guidelines Mushy, honest!! ૮( ´⁰▱๋⁰` )ა* 
But uh... I like to share it with anyone else awake too ahehe... ૮ ˆﻌˆ; ა
I usually save some extra for da' bestie since they have a habit of sleeping in! I always look out for my friends! ૮(> ﻌ•)ა
The rest of my day usually depends on what day of the week it is or what our calendars are filled up with! It's usually always started with everyone training together. It's usually tough since conditions are just as tough too, but it's still fun in the end. ໒( = ᴥ =)ʋ

After all our official activities are over, I like to swing by the café to get some sweet goodies with friends!! Sometimes they have a lottery and you get tickets depending on how many items you buy. Some of the prizes are sooooo cute!!!! Though... I've only got to 2nd place from the prize lists... twice... ૮(•́︿•̩̥̀ )ა
I know I do my hair most of the time, but sometimes a gal just wants someone else to do it. So if I'm feeling a bit lazy or just want some selfcare, I head down to the spa for some extra TLC. It just feels soooo good getting my scalp scratched reallll good by someone else. ໒( = ᴥ =)ʋ
I think Paris is the only person I trust my life with for my hair! Nothing worse than getting your hair damaged by a bad stylist. ૮(•̀ꐧ•́)ა
Wowee, I've been answering this question for awhile now ahehe... ૮ ˆﻌˆ; ა 
<em>(I laughed and nodded softly, gesturing her to continue.)</em>
Other than that, nothing else is really special for my daily routine! Work on some sewing, hanging with my besties, eating our dinner together and goofing off after, doing my long exhaustive hair routine for the night... nothing crazy! ໒( = ᴥ =)ʋ

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Hmmm... for me, it has to be Iceland!  ૮ ♡ﻌ♡ა
The scenery is so so pretty there! A lot of the food made there is so fresh... I just couldn't get enough!! A café I went to had homemade jams and cheeses for the pastries and it was so... 
<em>(She does a little angelic choir voice.)</em>
...just a god send of flavor and freshness in your mouth. ૮(✪⋏✪)ა
The Blue Lagoon there is soooo pretty and relaxing too. Sometimes a big race will you leave a bit sore no matter how much training you do, so it was just refreshing to sit in a hot spring!!! ૮ ᴖﻌᴖა 
My muscles and cares just melted away like butter~ ໒( = ᴥ =)ʋ
I remember it was so hard for Mushy to get me out!
<em>(She starts laughing really loud from the memory of it.)</em>
Whew, it was tough leaving that hot water! ໒(≧ ε ≦ )ა 
Overall, it was a very pleasant experience!! ૮ ᴖﻌᴖა

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
I really want to go to Antarctica!! ૮(✪⋏✪)ა
I would just love to see one of the most remote places on Earth. I can only imagine how fresh the air is-- well, besides the penguin poop smell from what i've heard hehe ૮ ᴖﻌᴖა-- and just see it for all its beauty~ ૮ ˘ﻌ˘ ა
Did you know there's an island there called Deception Island? It has an active magma pocket underneath! If you go onto the shore or into the shallow waters, you actually feel warm and not cold 'cause of it! The sand there is a black color too, which is just sooo cool through and through! ૮ ᴖﻌᴖა
Unfortunately, dogs aren't allowed to visit anymore, so it's a hopeless dream ૮ ◞ ﻌ ◟ ა 
<em>(She wipes away an imaginary tear.)</em>

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I've gotten a lotta praise and recognition during my modeling times, so now my goal is just to make Ilion famous and have a massiveeee collection of our gold medals to show off!! ૮(✪⋏✪)ა
Everyone's hard work needs to be seen and appreciated and Kam Kam will do anything it takes for that to happen!! #IlionSweep! ᕦ૮( •̀ω•́ U)ᕤ

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
Please, please, pleaseeee, can we get better Wi-fi, Musher? ૮(◞‸◟; )ა
It's so hard sometimes in certain parts of the sanctuary to check my phone!!! I want to keep my blog updated as much as I can to help promote us... ૮(•́︿•̩̥̀ )ა </3

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
I don't think there's anything that they need to improve!! ૮(> ﻌ•)ა
They've been so wonderful listening to everyone, and so understanding, especially since a lot of us come from different backgrounds! ૮ ᴖﻌᴖა
If I haveee to say something maybe, "Good job Mushy!! Be the best you are, which you already do!!! Let me make you some hair accessories too please! We need some personality in your outfits, and it's subtle enough to wear!" hehe ૮(> ﻌ•)ა 

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
Hm... 
<em>(She tilts head to the side.)</em>
From what I've read, I'm gonna have to say Togo! ૮ ᴖﻌᴖა
Balto gets all the glory for delivering the last batches of the serum-- which is great too, I'm not discrediting a fellow sled dog! ૮ ´• ﻌ ´• ა -- but I feel like Togo should get more recognition too! If Togo didn't make it, the serums wouldn't have even had the chance to be passed onto Balto!! ᘳ´• ᴥ •`ᘰ
I like to think I have pretty good endurance, but to travel 260 miles, leading the pack through tough-ass trails with temperatures low as -30 F, wind chill being even colder AND making it in time with people's lives on the line?!?!? Whew! That could give anyone gray hairs just thinking about it...! ଽ ૮( ⁰▱๋⁰ )ა 
*Well he was 12 when he ran this so I guess it fits...but still!૮(◞‸◟; )ა*
Both of them went through so much and I doubt I could even do half of what they did, but Togo definitely needs more love in the end I think!!! ૮(•̀ꐧ•́)ა

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
We're gonna serve you up Jersey Devil style!! ૮(•̀ꐧ•́)ა 
Also, you guys gotta tell me where you get your cute clothes from... Maybe we can swap clothing sources~  ૮ > ﻌ♡ა

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Hope you guys support this Jersey Gal Devil flying down the snowy path and the rest of Ilion!! Also, don't forget to check my blog out for updates happening with me or the base too!!!! ૮ ᴖﻌᴖა
Kamira out! ૮୨୧ > ﻌ ♡)ა
<em>(Phew! This interview was a lot to transcribe! Kamira had a lot of fun answering the questions!)</em>
