<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
My name is Brandy I’m the Ilion Sanctuary’s cutest dog 💕💕 

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
I’d rather be in Paris shopping to my hearts content… but it’s not all bad. Musher takes great care of me💕 and I know that everyone will die without me here 💕 

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
Winning, of course! 💕

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Getting sweaty and dirty and gross while running! 💔 

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
Never 💕 Being nervous and anxious is a loser’s attitude 💕 I just tell myself and the team we’re the best, and we are! 💕

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
I would answer myself… but it does feel nice when the Musher compliments me when I’m tired 💕

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
Going shopping for cute clothes! 💕 Looking cute! 💕 Taking selfies 💕 Having the Musher brush my h- I mean. Brushing my own hair 💕

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
I wake up early so I can start my beauty regime! I need to look good every day or I’ll DIE!! I don’t care if we’re training out in the mud, I want to look good while doing it!! 
<em>(He continues to rant for around 30 minutes about how his clothes and hair usually gets messy through out the day and how he wants the Musher to pay attention to him more while he works “SOOO HARD!!🥺🥺”)</em>
Then I go do my beauty regime before I go to bed! 💕

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Sweden was really beautiful… Reminds me a bit of home actually. 

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
Teehee, PARIS! 💕 

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
Winning the race competition to the North Pole 💕 I heard some people talking about it, and how only the best of the best can be there, a once in a lifetime race! I want to be there and WIN! 💕 

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
PAY MORE ATTENTION TO ME!!! 💔 I HAVE SPLIT ENDS ON MY HAIR AND I NEED YOU TO CUT IT!!! THE PEOPLE AT THE GROOMERS WON’T DO!!!! 
<em>(He is throwing a full body tantrum.)</em>

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
You need to take me shopping again and spoil me 🥺 You’re so busy now and I just want one-on-one time… but it’s not like I miss you!!! I JUST WANT CLOTHES!!! CLOTHES YOU BUY!!! AND PICK OUT!!! FOR ME!!! 

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
Who? 💕 
<em>(He’s smirking, he clearly knows who they are and he has an opinion on both but isn’t telling me.)</em>

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
We’re better than you and we’re going to beat you in every race we’re in with you 💕 

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>  
Thanks for the interview 💕 I’m glad you’re interviewing me as the sole representative of the Ilion Sanctu- wait you’re not? You’re interviewing everyone? WH-
