<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Hiya, I'm Kima! It was kinda unexpected, but I'm one of the musher's lead dogs for the long-distance team. Other than that, I also love doing photography! I've taken some for the sanctuary before.

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
Amazing! I love travelling and it's so nice to travel with other fun and interesting dogs. 

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
I was scared at first because I didn't think I could do a good job since I had less experience than the other dogs, but now I love the rush I get from it-- it's like how I feel when I'm taking photos!

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Hmm.... Experiencing that moment when it feels like we're losing. I hate seeing parts of the team lose morale. But it's okay, we still give our all for every race! There are also some other dogs on the team that never fail to give me that extra boost I need to keep going.

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
YES. I'm not sure if the others notice, but I always get anxious before we start, so I hate that feeling... but don't worry, it disappears quickly! I just keep reminding myself that people believe in me and that I shouldn't let the team down. Once we actually start, the nervousness goes away.

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
The musher and the other dogs. We all try to keep each other's spirits up. I get even more serious and keep going because I also don't want to let any of them down.

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
Yesss, I love travelling and doing photography! Before joining Ilion, I was travelling with my mentor who taught me everything I know about taking great photos.

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
When we're not preparing for a race? I like waking up early-- a habit from when I was with my mentor-- and take a lot of stills of the area. I actually like having some alone-time too, so the morning's the best for that before all the louder dogs start waking up. Then, most of my day is just going around to mingle, especially at the cafe, exercise, and look for opportunities to take more photos. A lot of the others probably think I'm just lazing around when they see me from behind trying to take stills, haha.

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
I loooooved Norway! I was able to get so many beautiful pictures over there. I'm also from Alaska, so when I saw the northern lights there, it made me think about my hometown when I was younger.

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
Australia! Or, definitely some place my mentor and I haven't been to yet! I'd love to take some unique photos to send him.

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I want to travel to every country in the world and I'd also like for Ilion to be well-known all over the world! 

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
Uhmmm... nothing really comes to mind. I've been enjoying life here as it is. I think there are other dogs who might have some feedback to share though.

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
The musher has always encouraged me during training and was okay with me taking it easy during downtime. Musher, if you're reading this, then please get some more rest!! 

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
They're both Alaskan heroes... I can't choose between them! 
<em>(Interviewer: Oh right, Kima said she's from Alaska too...)</em>

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
No matter if we win or lose, let's all take a photo together at the end! Don't worry, I'll get your good side :)

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Is this gonna be posted online for everyone to see or something? Can I say a few words to my mentor? Hi, mentor!! I was just at Yellowknie! Did you already get the new photos I sent you? I hope we can meet again soon. 
<em>(Interviewer: She really gets excited when she talks about her mentor... jadlasjds;a)</em>
