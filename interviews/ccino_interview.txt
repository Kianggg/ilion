<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Huh? Ah, yes. My name. I am Ccino.
<em>(She makes a peace sign as she says this. Due to her monotone voice and covered mouth, it is difficult to interpret such an action).</em>
I am everyone's guardian angel, poyo.

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
Hm... 
<em>(She looks around for some time, almost like as if trying to find the answer somewhere in the far distance.)</em>
It is nice. It is much better being here, in a way.

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
My favorite part, I wonder... I think... Hm...? Ah, I know. When we need to think fast and avoid obstacles. It makes me feel very smart, poyo. 
<em>(She makes another peace sign.)</em>
Ah, also when we arrive at the finish line, it is... fulfilling.
<em>(She nods at herself a couple of times, agreeing with herself.)</em>

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Being... out there... in the cold. Pien...

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
Always! Always for sure. I get so worried something bad will happen to anyone in the team... I always have a chewing toy with me so I can calm down, like this one. 
<em>(She hands me over one of her toys, and goes on a tangent for a while talking about it.)</em>

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
Must! Be! Strong! So! I! Can! Help! Everyone! Poyo! 
<em>(This time she makes a double peace sign. Her voice is still somewhat monotone, but I can feel how important the idea is to her. It also feels like it's something she must repeat to herself when going through those difficult moments.)</em>

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
I often work at the clinic. Is that a hobby? I like being there a lot... Would that be my passion? Hm...

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
I usually watch the TV until someone comes to take me somewhere, hehe... poyo.

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Japan, ehem! It was nice being able to go back home while being a useful member of the team. 
<em>(Her eyes wander and she seems lost in her thoughts, while playing with her pigtails.)</em>

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
Aloha, Hawaii! 
<em>(She makes a double shaka sign.)</em>
I really feel like I was originally meant to be born there, pien.

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I feel like they already came true after I came here. 
<em>(She nods, seemingly content with herself.)</em>

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
Eh? Uh... I don't know... everything seems nice to me.

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
Adopt all the dogs in the world so everyone can be happy together, poyo!!

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
Balto-san looked so handsome in that movie, poyo! I have watched it many times. Ah, does that mean I only like the actor? Eeh...?

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Stay inside if you don't want to lose! 
<em>(She pulls down her face mask and sticks her tongue out to the camera.)</em>

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
<em>(She makes another peace sign.)</em>
