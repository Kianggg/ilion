<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
... Yvette... 
<em>(She quietly looks away to the side to avoid eye contact.)</em>
........................... 
<em>(Long silence. She seems... REALLY anxious)</em>

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
..... <em>(clears throat)...</em> 
I appreciate being here, it's nice being surrounded by a lively crowd... 
<em>(She isn't really looking up at me, and is so focused on staring at her own lap while she's sitting down.)</em>
It reminds me of home, and the Musher is just as kind as my previous owners...

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
...It's nice exercise.
<em>(She has a small smirk, and quietly chuckles about it as she probably thinks this is funny.)</em>
I spent most of my time resting in the lodge before I came here... so it feels good to move around a lot.

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Mmm... 
<em>(She rubs her arm.)</em>
I feel a little anxious around the others, and can't help but feel incompetent in what I do. Like I'm pulling the others back... this tends to eat away at my confidence. 
<em>(She let's out a small sigh.)</em>
...Am I scaring the other dogs on my team? 
<em>(She lowers her ears out of concern.)</em>
I'm not on the team as often, so it makes me think.... 

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
U-Urp...
<em>(She shivers.)</em>
A-Absolutely... I feel bad for having to go to the Musher to calm me down... 
<em>(She's gripping at her arm.)</em>
In fact, I feel like I go to the Musher so often that I forget that I'm at a big race... 
<em>(She shudders, and shakes her head.)</em>
Désolé,* Musher. 

<em>*"Désolé" = "Sorry" in French.</em>

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
I just think of home... My owners used to do these races with me. I always think of them, and whenever I race, I just remember that I'm doing this for them. 
<em>(She nods, with serious look on her face.)</em>
I am an icon to my home. I'd like to make them proud, even if I am far from Chamonix. 

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
...I can't say I have many hobbies... I suppose I am simple.
<em>(She makes a nervous shrug.)</em>
I've been so used to sitting and being someone that greets guests at the door <em>(quiet chuckle).</em>

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
I sleep, and go for walks outside, maybe snuggle by the fireplace with my favorite keepsake... 
<em>(She shows me an old knitted shawl.)</em>
This is from home, it helps me sleep <em>(nod).</em>
Oh, sometimes I like to watch the other sled dogs from afar while I am on my strolls, and... I just imagine myself talking with them... 
<em>(She blushes out of embarrassment and looks away, but her tail is wagging.)</em>
A-Ah, sorry, I was caught up in my own thoughts... 
<em>(She nods and rubs her the side of her neck.)</em>

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Switzerland. It's vaguely similar to France, but with more beautiful mountains... <em>(nod)</em> Never have I seen so much green grass during the summer season... Ç'est beau.* I participated in a Swiss holiday before one of my races. This country gives much love and care to their animals. 
<em>(She makes a small smile.)</em>
Perhaps I only enjoyed this place so much because its mountains reminded me of Mont Blanc**. Although this place is beautiful, it's awful for your wallet. The poor Musher was... looking at their wallet with such an empty look in their eyes after they realized how much a single cup of coffee costed... <em>(quiet chuckle)</em>

<em>*translation = it's beautiful
**Mountain in Chamonix</em>

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
Germany is right next to France... <em>(nod)</em> I'd like to try their various meats there. I was told it's delicious. 
<em>(She wags her tail with an empty look on her face, but she's clearly interested and excited at the thought.)</em>
Please... take me there someday.  

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I... want to look cool. 
<em>(She blushes, and covers her face a little from being shy.)</em>
But... I suppose the more ideal goal is to get better at making friends, if I can just get comfortable enough with others, my racing would improve so much... 
<em>(She sighs deeply, hunches back and looks gloomy after thinking about it.)</em>

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
...I want longer hours being pampered at the spa.
<em>(She wags her tail really fast.)</em>
N-No, it's not because I like... being pampered, well... <em>(gulp)</em> maybe... Oooohhh..... 
<em>(She grips her hair out of embarrassment.)</em>

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
I... would appreciate being told directly and asked personally on what needs to be improved...
<em>(She rubs her hands together and stares at her lap.)</em>
...rather than being told as a group. I... I feel like it's better for me to follow along if I'm pulled aside and I am told what I need to do... 
<em>(She's lost in thought, but is clearly anxious about it.)</em>

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
Togo... or Balto...? 
<em>(She tilts her head while thinking in silence.)</em>
I heard stories about them, but I don't know too much about them to give you my opinion. <em>(nod)</em> Désolé, I-I hope that isn't a problem.. 

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
.......... <em>(staring)</em> 
O-Oh, am I supposed to say something mean, or..? 
<em>(She nervously looks away, almost as if assuming she HAS to say something mean about them.)</em>
A-Ah, well, I hope we can still have fun even when competing against one another... 

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
...Please, if you ever have the time, visit Chamonix.
<em>(Her tail wags, with a determined look on her face.)</em>
Ah, specifically: "Chalet&Ski du Glacier". I am the mascot of this business, which is currently being managed by my former owner's son. It is a beautiful ski resort, so... 
<em>(She smiles shyly.)</em>
M-Merci beaucoup...
<em>(And a polite bow.)</em>
T-Thank you for taking the time to interview me...
