<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Hello everyone~! (⁠▼◠⁠ᴥ⁠・⁠)⁠—⁠☆ I'm Canela and I'm Ilion's cutest and most stylish dog~!! (⁠∩^ ⁠ᴥ⁠ ^∩) 
*But don't tell the others, hihi.*

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
Ummm... Where do I start, when I first got here I really didn't want to have to train or participate in races and didn't know I'd have to live with so many other dogs and I hateeeed it (>⁠ω⁠<;⁠), so I would just try to skip practice and do whatever I wanted hehe (⁠｡⁠ﾉ⁠ω⁠＼⁠｡⁠)... But after a while I started noticing how everyone started complimenting me for my skills so I started liking racing more after that~! 
*But if I could skip training whenever I wanted I still would...* 
Also I love being part of a team with so many pretty and popular dogs like Halibut, Kamira, Kikky, Olive, Roann, Millius and so many others...I feel like I fit right in~ ☆—(⁠◠⁠ᴥ⁠◕⁠ʋ⁠)

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
Getting praised after doing a good job, winning, plus it's a nice way to release stress~ 

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Getting scolded by the Musher after messing up (usually because I was distracted.. (⁠´⁠；⁠ω⁠；⁠｀⁠)), or even worse, having the other dogs yell at you for it.. IT GETS ON MY NERVES ⁠ヽ⁠(ꐦꐦ`⁠Д⁠´⁠)⁠ﾉ!!!!! Like, first of all you're not the Musher, so when that happens I say something right back and they can't even come up with a good comeback... most of the time ^_^''

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
I used to at first, but now I love it (⁠☆⁠ᴥ☆ ⁠)~! Getting ready for a big race is a lot like getting ready for a big dog show ^_^ I always make sure to get my fur washed and especially my tail nice and trimmed, and get lots of cute new accessories to show off at the race, that's my most favorite part (⁠♡⁠ω⁠♡⁠ ⁠)⁠ ⁠~⁠♪

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
The fact that I know that we're all together in it and that no matter what the results are, after it's done we're all going back to our sanctuary where we're all safe and loved and everyone takes care of us, so that's what pushes me to always want to cross the finish line!!! 
<em>(Interviewer's thought: Wow... I didn't know she had this sentimental side to her...)</em>

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
Ummm... Updating my blog, buying and making cute accessories for me and the other dogs~!! Giving them manicures against their will~ ✧⁠◝⁠(⁠⁰⁠▿⁠⁰⁠)⁠◜⁠✧ 
*Especially Yukola and Olivier, they hate it so much hehehe >.<''*

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
Besides what I just told you... On my day to day life I just like to do what I want~! I don't really have a routine (⁠≧ω≦⁠) I like to hangout at the cafe and hav— ummm... never mind ^_^;; ~!!! 
<em>(Interviewer thought: Did she just whisper something about having sweet treats at the cafe all day....?)</em>
I also like to occasionally go shopping for cute things with the other dogs like with Kikky, Brandy, Olive, Kamira... It's really fun (⁠◠⁠‿⁠・⁠)⁠—⁠☆

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Honestly, the snowy scenery to me looks the same everywhere, but I love when we go to countries like France, South Korea, Germany, Canada or other places in the US like New York and we make a detour to visit the city, there's always a lot of cool stuff to see~! (⁠◠⁠‿⁠・⁠)⁠—⁠☆⁠☆⁠☆⁠☆⁠☆

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
We still haven't been able to visit Tokyo (⁠｡⁠♡⁠‿⁠♡⁠｡⁠)

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
Be the most followed dog on Dogstagram (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠)⁠✧ 

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
We really need more funds for the dog salon and spa.............

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
I don't know... Our diet and training regimen doesn't have to be so strict? (⁠ ◠ ⁠ᴥ・⁠)⁠—⁠☆

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
My ultimate idol is VENUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (⁠♡⁠ω⁠♡⁠ )(⁠♡⁠ω⁠♡⁠ ⁠)⁠ (⁠♡⁠ω⁠♡⁠ ⁠)⁠ (⁠♡⁠ω⁠♡⁠ ⁠)⁠ ⁠~.⁠｡⁠*⁠♡

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Ilion's dogs will always be the cutest! (⁠◠⁠‿⁠・⁠)⁠—⁠☆

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b> 
I almost forgot but follow me on Dogstagram!! @canelisammypink886 (⁠.⁠ ⁠❛⁠ o ◠.⁠)✧｡⁠*ﾟ⁠+⁠*⁠.⁠✧
