<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
I'm sprinnnttttt STAR Timothy Bestwick from Illion's Sprint Team!! I'll keep doing my best to make Musher proud! <em>(LOUD!)</em>

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
I loveeeee it here!!! Everyday is so much fun!!! 
<em>(His little tail is wiggling so much, so cute...)</em> 
I love my team mates, and my friends, Kikky and Jacky, but more than anything I love to take a good nap <em>( T﹏﹏T ♥)</em>

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
Everything!!! I love to go super fassttttt!!! It's almost as if sometimes I could take flight! Running alongside all my friends and Musher really makes my heart race!

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Oh boy! Oh boy!!! I don't like it when I'm not taken seriously! Just because I'm small, it doesnt mean I can't sprint! I get tired easily, but that's nothing when EXTRA food and EXTRA sleep make for a quick recovery!!!

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
I DO!!!!!! But whenever I feel nervous I remenber how Lord Bestwick is rooting for me! This medalion of mine... It reminds me of all my most precious memories!!! This is how I know I will do my absolute best! <em>(His expression! So determined!)</em>

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
Every race is a challenge! But Musher and Kikky always cheer me up! PLUS, I look up to my team members Orca and Kirsi and it makes me want to be at my absolute best!  I'm sure with their help even I, Timothy Bestwick, can become the fastest sled dog Ilion has ever seen!!! 
<em>(He's so excited... I don't want to lower his morale, hehe.)</em>

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
I love collecting treasures!!! I used to do it all the time at Hollyhead with Master, but over here at Ilion, I have found out about sooo many new wonderful things! OHH! I even found a hurt birdie once! 
<em>(Oh!)</em> 
Musher and Jacky tied up the birdie's wing, and before I even noticed, it was ready to fly again! 

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
I RUN! I SLEEP! I EAT! ANDDDD... I also play a lot!!! 
<em>(That seems about right, haha!)</em> 

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
SWITZERLAND! SWITZERLAND!!! It was sooo beautiful and all the tall mountains with snowy tops really made me realize how strong St. Bernards like Newfie are!! In one of my treasure hunts there, I found a nice lady who gave me a little bit of cheese and it was sooooo GOOD! BUT PLEASE DONT TELL MUSHER!!! 
<em>(They'll be able to read this, though...)</em>

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
EGYPT!!! 
<em>(WHATTTT? EGYPT?)</em>
Lord Bestwick used to love Egypt a lot, so I'm sure if I could go there one day I would love it too!! Plus, I'm sure I would be able to find all sorts of shiny treasures there! 

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I want to be a sprint STAR!! I want to make Musher and Master proud!!! But most importantly, I want the other dogs that join us at Ilion to look up to me one day like how I look up to my team mates! 

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
I love it here, but if I could request a fluffly new blacket! OH, and a new ribbon to tie my ponytail, AND MAYBE a ribbon of each color of the rainbow to go with the days of the week! OHHHH, and what about new toys??!! Maybe a fancy leash??!! OH AND- 
<em>(...)</em>

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
MUSHER I LOVE YOU!!!! 

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
BALTO! Balto is a legeeeenddd and one day, I, Timothy Bestwick, will be one too!!! I couldn't keep my tears watching Baltos struggles and determination in the movie and it made me superrrrrrrr eager to do my absolute best...! 
<em>(Ah, he wants a movie of his own too... I see.)</em> 

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
HEI! See if you can catch me!! Sprint Star Timothy Bestwick is coming THRUUUUU!!!! <em>★ (He's jumping around!)</em>

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
I want to send out a hugeeee HUG to Master Bestwick!! I can't wait to see you once again next winter!!!
