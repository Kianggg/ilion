<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Vieno..................... <em>(long silence)</em>
<em>(VISIBLY SWEATING AND SHAKING)</em>

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
Scary............! But I'm happy. I've made friends who believe in me....

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
I have a place and purpose. I can't do without my team and my team can't do without me. 
<em>(She looks up for the first time, wagging her tail.)</em> 
While racing, we can forget about everything else and get immersed in the rush and excitement! It's like we become a single entity working together! Working hard towards an important goal! Everyone's effort counts! 

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
............ <em>(stares down)</em>
<em>(She doesn't seem to know what to say.)</em>

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
I try not to think about it... All the fear fades out as soon as you start pulling... I just have to keep that in mind...

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
I can't let everyone down... </em>(Her ears flop down.)</em>

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
I was born to be a hunter. So I fish and catch whatever I can... I created a trap to catch squirrels that has been very effective, I can give you a pelt if you promise not to tell anyone about them............. 
<em>(She looked around nervously. Is this allowed...??)

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
If we are not training, I'll run off. I won't tell where.

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Home... the scent in the air was very different from what I remembered, yet so very familiar.

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
I would like to visit home..... or past home... in the Summer. 
<em>(Probably meaning Finland.)</em>
It's beautiful out there. But I'm happy at Ilion. My life is here, now. Nothing is missing.

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I hope I can make my friends and family proud someday...

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
</em>(shaking head)</em>

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
They are already working hard...

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
What kind of question is this...? Everyone is a hero. Working together. 

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Uuuuuuuuhhh.......................................................

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
<em>(She runs out and returns with a stinky squirrel pelt, then runs off again.)</em>
