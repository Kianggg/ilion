<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Tanya. I am very fast and I love to run. But I love the Musher more than running.

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
I love Ilion! Big family, many friends. I take care of them. 

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
I love to run!! But running with my friends is even better. 

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Sometimes we have to stop.

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
I love to race!! I trust the Musher and I trust my team. I love my team! I only feel excited and ready to run.

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
I love to win!

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
I love the snow. And I love to look at the pictures in Orcaâ€™s books. They make no sense!

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
I wake up. Greet the Musher. Run around the sanctuary a few times. Check if everyone is awake. Make sure everyone eats. Run some more.

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
I love running at home best! But Greenland has pretty lights sometimes, too, so I would like to go there again. Just like home!

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
I would like to visit this land called "Education" that Orca seems to love a lot.

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I want to run forever with my team and the musher!

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
I love the Musher!! I think more food would be good. Some of the dogs are still so small and skinny. 
<em>(He spoke with worry.)</em>

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
The Musher is perfect!

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
I love the Balto movie!!! I want to be a hero too!

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
No. 

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Do I get a treat?
