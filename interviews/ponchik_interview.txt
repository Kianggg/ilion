<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Ponchik!! I'm a racer for Ilion! ^o^

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
It's amazing!! I love racing, and I love my teammates... being a part of Ilion makes me so happy! 

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
The energy!! It's so much fun! I also love the reward of hard work at the end of a race!

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Sometimes it can be really stressful.. I don't like seeing anyone overwork themselves, or get hurt...

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
Oh, yes! But in that case, instead of thinking about everything that could go wrong, I just imagine all of us together once the race is over! Giving hugs.. celebrating.. sharing a big meal... mm... 
<em>(Is she drooling?)</em>

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
My teammates, and the Musher! We're like a family, so I always try my best for them!

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
Hmm... eating? Hehehe. I also love watching the sky, the birds, the Earth... is there a word for that? I guess I'm passionate about life! 

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
Wake up! Eat breakfast! Help with errands! Train! Play! Train! Eat! Go to bed. Honk, shoo, honk, shoo~

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Ooh maybe... Germany? It was so close to home! Plus so many yummy meats... 
<em>(...Drooling again!?)</em>

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
Brazil!

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
Hm... I'm pretty happy with what I have now! I guess my dream is for this to last for a long time...

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
Mmmno! I think it's perfect already!!

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
I'm grateful for everything the musher's done, I think they're doing a great job!! 

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
Both... there must be peace.....

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Hiiii! 
<em>(She waves energetically.)</em>

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Thank you for having me!!
