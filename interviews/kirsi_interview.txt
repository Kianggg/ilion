<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
<em>(Her ears perk up & stand to attention.)</em>
Yess'm!! 
<em>(She salutes with a big grin.)</em>
My name is Kirsi, and I'm a sprint and mid-distance dog runner for the official Ilion Team! 
<em>(She's counting it out on her fingers one by one.)</em>
If you need me to run, I'll run! If you need me to jump, I'll jump! If you need me to swim, I'll swim! 
<em>(I don't think you need to swim...)</em>
There's nothing I won't do! I'm currently two spots away from the front of the team...
<em>(She raises her hand, yelling in declaration.)</em>
...but I believe I'll be in the leader position by the next big race! 

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
<em>(Her ears are fluttering.)</em>
Being able to run for Ilion is the BEST!!! Ilion saw my *true* potential, and invited me even when no one wanted me!
<em>(She's saying it so proudly...)</em>
I know it's sappy... but the Ilion members and staff are like my family! What could be better than getting to run and train and eat with your family every day?

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
"Favorite?" That's a silly question! 
<em>(She crosses her arms.)</em>
What isn't there to like about racing? The cold wind when it hits your face... 
<em>(She makes motions with her hands to mimic something big hitting her face.)</em>
...the crunch of snow under your feet... 
<em>(She jumps up and down.)</em>
...pulling so hard like you're gonna' die! 
<em>(She grips her throat playfully.)</em>
Buuuut, if I had to pick one thing I like the MOST, most...
<em>(She lowers her hands from her throat.)</em>
I think the best part is when we win and Musher makes the beeeeest expression! 
<em>(She's grinning stupidly.)</em>
I can't get enough of that! I wanna see it all the time! Nothing beats winning!!! 

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Well... 
<em>(Her ears droop a little and her tail swishes side to side anxiously.)</em>
If winning is the 'best' part... I guess that makes losing the 'worst' part, right? I dunno! But ya'know, everyone loses sometimes! Just because you lose doesn't mean you should get discouraged! It's just more reason to get better and win...
Actually, I'll change my answer! I can handle losing, but... I think the worst part is when the team fights. Everyone's so different...
<em>(She blinks, as if suddenly realizing something.)</em>
AH! I mean, it's not like we fight a lot-- but it just makes it worse when people do argue. 

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
Nervous? What is there to be nervous about? Musher and everyone else is working so hard... if I have time to be nervous, then I'm not working hard enough! 

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
There's no other choice! We have to keep going! Maybe that sounds stupid, but it's kind of like...
<em>(She's taking a long pause as if thinking really hard.)</em>
...if everyone decided they wanted to stop because it's hard, then we'd never finish the race? Ya'know? And that'd be even worse than whatever is making things tough in the moment! 

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
Train!! Eat!! Sleep!! Train!! Oh! I also really like watching comedy skits online when Musher lets me use the computer hehe! My favorite channel only has 200 subscribers, but they're really funny! Musher will sometimes watch with me! The other dogs say they're not that funny, but I've seen Musher laugh sometimes! 

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
Wake up! 
<em>(She's counting on her fingers again.)</em>
Run with my tire! 
<em>(Her... 'tire?')</em>
Do weight training! Eat my special soup! 
<em>('Special?!')</em>
Run with my tire again! Sleep! 
<em>(Is that... all?)</em> 

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Everywhere is fun!! Races are about the race, not the place! BUT, if I had to pick one place... I like when we have races in Finland! It smells like home! Ergh-- I mean, Ilion is my home now, but it's the scent of when I was a baby! That kind of home smell... 

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
I wanna go to the moon with Musher and everyone at Ilion! Our first space race! When there's no gravity, it doesn't matter if you're big or small! I'm sure I could be the best lead dog there! 

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I WILL BE THE LEAD DOG IN OUR NEXT BIG PANTHEON RACE!!!! 
<em>(She blinks as if realizing something.)</em>
-- AH! AND WE'LL PLACE NUMBER ONE!!! 
<em>(She points with her finger frantically.)</em>
NUMBER ONE!! 
<em>(She's laughing kind of crazed.)</em>

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
Huh? Musher did? I think the sanctuary is perfect! What more could a dog need?

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
Musher is already the best! Buuuut..... if I had to pick something, I wish Musher would run with me more during training! It'd be fun if we could run every day together! 

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
TOGO!!! 100%!!!!! I'm gonna run 200-- no, 300 miles in his honor!!!!!

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Ilion #1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Thank you very much for the interview opportunity! I'll work hard to be the best lead dog Ilion has ever seen! Please continue to support the Ilion Sanctuary, and cheer for us at our next big race!
