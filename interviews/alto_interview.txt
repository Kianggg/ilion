<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
<em>(She stares blankly at me, blinking slowly.)</em>
Umm... Alto... I'm Alto. I like... sleeping... umm... I like... 
.......... 
<em>(She stares blankly at me again.)</em>
I like... cuddling...

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
Oohhh... it's very nice... it's very warm. There's so much space.....

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
Running... non-stop... running. 
<em>(She stares blankly again, but smiles.)</em>
I love to... run 'til my legs give out... 

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Ummm.... I don't like bullies. Sometimes... some teams aren't nice 'cause we're rivals... I don't like bullies...

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
I think... Musher gets more nervous... um, my eye... they worry 'bout that but... um... I feel good... I know I do my best, and my friends... I'm not alone, so I can do my best... um...
<em>(Alto does another slow blink.)</em>
I take a... before race nap... that helps me... 

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
Ummm.... momma- uh... my... my mother... she ran too... I'll run just like her... 

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
Oh... I like music...! I... touching instruments... makes me nervous... don't wanna break them, yea? Oh... but... I love... I love watching stuff too... 
<em>(She stops and stares at me again for a period before I ask the next question, with a big smile on her face.)</em>

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
Mmmmm... I wake up... usually when my sleeping mates are gone or my blanket is gone... um... I try not to fall back asleep... I eat last... but that's ok, I'm ok... umm... hmm... 
..... 
I follow other dogs 'round... I like watching... Gau and his garden... or... Yukola... running... 
.....
I sometimes just stand there... all day... 
.....
I like sitting in the cafe... lots of interesting folks come in and out... then suddenly... the sun's gone! Bed time again! 

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Ummm... we went to a country that smelt really nice a while ago... um... it was quiet and... smelt nice... I took a really good nap... um... what was that place... Coldland! 
<em>("Did you mean Iceland?" I asked.)</em>
Yes...! Yes... Iceland! It smelt so nice... so many trees... reminded me of home...!! The trees and the space... the people were so nice too... I didn't understand them but... they smiled. 

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
I'd... like to go... to... um... oh... 
..... to bed!
<em>(Alto wags her tail, and nods, very pleased with her answer. The question was posed again, but Alto didn't seem to get it.)</em>

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I want to... make Musher proud of me... I want to make... mother proud.....

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
Um... a giant bed where we can all sleep together...!

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
Don't worry... so much... about me..... this eye of mine won't... get in my way... you've saved me... I will... I will make you proud. 

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
I... love both... I love both of them... um... I'd marry Togo though...

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
<em>(For the first time, Altos expression hardens.)</em>
Don't look down on me... just... because of this... affliction... I can race just as hard and good at you all. 

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
<em>(Alto returns to the previous soft expression, and she yawns.)</em>
I'm ready for a nap...
