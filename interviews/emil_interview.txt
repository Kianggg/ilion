<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
I'm Emil! I'm a Samoyed from Canada! I used to not be a sled dog, but now I am and it's so much more fun. I like to be lazy, too, though...

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
It's fun! I like sledding! All the dogs are fun to be around and we get to do so much stuff together. Uh, but sometimes Musher is kinda strict. I mean, I'm usually good, but sometimes I get scolded for hiding stuff. Once I got in trouble for hiding my harness under some furniture that Musher couldn't reach. 
<em>(He looks genuinely remorseful for a couple seconds.)</em>
But usually Musher is really nice and I like it when we get to take a nap together.

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
The best part is listening close to Musher in the Wheel position! I get to be right next to the sled! I like showing off my strength!

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
I don't mind that much if we lose, but some dogs get sad when we lose and sometimes Musher gets disappointed if something goes wrong. So I don't really like that part. 

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
Sometimes, but mostly I just get excited to run! I don't really care that much! But if Musher seems nervous then I get nervous too...
But chasing a squirrel will always make me feel better!

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
I want everyone to keep being happy, so I try really hard to stay strong for the team!!

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
<em>(Emil drags over a large laundry basket full of plush toys in various states of disrepair.)</em>
I LOVE PLUSHIES! I have a lot of favorites. I even take plushies that other dogs already played with. Musher sometimes gives me their old toys. I don't care if they're messed up! But nothing's better than a new plushie!
I also like all kinds of other animals! Some dogs don't like cats, but I really like them. I like when cats take a nap in my fluff! 

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
I get really excited when we eat breakfast and sometimes I eat way too fast. I get super hungry.
<em>(He appears to be drooling a little bit.)</em>
If I get to run, I always do my best! But sometimes I also stay behind and spend time at the clinic or when we do summer tours! I like to make sure everyone is in a good mood.

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
I like all the places we go! Unless it's too hot! I have long fur and I don't like when it gets really hot outside. I get really lazy when it's hot outside. 
I like when we get to go to Canada, especially Alberta, because sometimes I get to see people I knew from my old life!

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
Ummm... What's the coldest place out there? I want to know how cold I could get before I can't race anymore! I bet I could be really cold. 

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I want Ilion to be the most famous sled team ever!! I also want to eat unlimited chicken. No one has let me do that yet.

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
We have a lot of plushies, but I think we could have more. That would make the sanctuary better. I think we should also keep more animals!!

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
<em>(He looks a little flustered by this question.)</em>
Oh! I don't know! They're really nice to me and the team. I just hope they always have fun!

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
I heard dogs arguing about this before... But I dunno... I never root for one dog. I think I could be friends with either of them.

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Don't feel bad when you lose!! I'll be nice to you! :D

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Thank you!! I had fun! I will do my best on the team, so everyone, please keep cheering for us!! And if you come to visit, please bring me a "squish mallow" plushie because those are the best.
