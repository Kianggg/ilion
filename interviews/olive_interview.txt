<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
YAã€œY â˜… ITâ€™S OLIVE! Your very own blue ribbon Chowsky, great to meet me, yeah? By the way, your fur is looking a little TOO ragged, let me brush it for you. No need to thank me~!

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
Oh this place?  When I first came here I was SO not used to the whole running in dirty snow for like a trillion miles thing. But agility training has its own charm too, yâ€™know? My figure has never looked better~! Plus, Musher takes me to the dog spa like twice a month so, I wonâ€™t complain TOO much~! â˜…

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
I LOVE the challenge. I was pretty bored at my old gig, being THE best and all, so climbing up to fame in a new genre is like, totes exciting~ Wonâ€™t be long until Iâ€™m the top star around here, just you watch~! â˜…

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Hmmm~ Iâ€™d say getting bits of icy snow pelted at my face during races. Yâ€™know when youâ€™re at the beach, and the wind blows sand at you and it totally feels like A BAJILLION needles are smacking ya? Imagine that but with FREEZING ice. Iâ€™d get goggles, but wouldnâ€™t that like, totally leave marks on my face?! 

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
Not really! The fashion gigs I used to model for were totes scarier. If anything, Iâ€™m like, super duper eager to just start running already~! GO GO GO !!! â˜…

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
Between you and me, if I feel the momentum dropping, I just start imaging this other show dog I used to HATE at my old gig is watching. I CANNOT lose in front of her. NO WAY!! ðŸ’¢

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
I LOOOVE going to the doggie spa and taking care of my fur. It gets tooooo messy after a long race, yâ€™know? I gotta make sure to keep it in top form off the track or else itâ€™s OVER. I also like playing with my teammatesâ€™ fur, like braiding and stuff... when they actually let me! Hmph!!

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
My, what a loaded question. Iâ€™d tell you my entire haircare routine but weâ€™d run out of time! But to keep it short and sweet, after my beauty sleep, I comb my fur out just a bit so that I donâ€™t look like a total slob when Musher calls us for breakfast. After we eat, I retouch up my fur to make sure no food went flying in it. *Some of my teammates are quite the messy eaters, no names mentioned...* I tie my fur into two perfect pigtails, and then go out for a light trot to get my blood flowing in top shape for our races. After chatting with my friends around the sanctuary, itâ€™s lunch time before I know it! After we eat, I get another few hours of beauty sleep. Nothing like a good nap after a good meal. â˜… After that, my day varies from training with the Musher, to making my Spa appointment, to giving the other dogs fashion advice if they realllly look like they need it. But once itâ€™s bedtime, Iâ€™m out cold! Theyâ€™re on their own~

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
I really loved Switzerland!! My gosh. The mountains are super beautiful, and the fashion there is adorable! The food is super yummy!!! Also, I had a ball at this one doggie spa they had there. I GOTTA go there again. 

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
Iâ€™ve been all over the globe at my old career, so itâ€™s hard to think of a new place I havenâ€™t been. Hmmm~ Maybe Australia? I havenâ€™t gone there yet but the pics are super pretty! I think warmer weather could be a good change of pace too~

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I want to be crowned Most Stylish Sled Dog Ever. I already dominated the show dog world, so letâ€™s freshen up that title yeah ?! â˜… I would totally love to visit every luxurious doggie spa in the world too. Then I could 1000% tell you which one is THE best. 

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
I really wish the sanctuary had personal stylists for each dog. Like, wouldnâ€™t that be super awesome?!

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
Tell them to increase my spa time from an hour to 3 hours, will ya?  Teeheeã€œ â˜…

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
Totes Balto!

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Donâ€™t bore me, okay~?  How can we call ourselves the greatest if we arenâ€™t challenging the best of the best? Although when it comes to style, thereâ€™s no competition for me, donâ€™t even try it. 

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Look forward to us absolutely killing it on the trail ! â˜… You all better come, Iâ€™m not messing my fur up for nothing, yâ€™know!
