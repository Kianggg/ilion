<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Hello there~!! My name is Kikky. ☆☆ I am a purebred poodle, owned by the renowned designer of pup clothes, Master Bernard.. after experiencing the beauty of the world by his side, I have been entrusted to the musher to help fulfill his side-passion of mushing!!

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
Boy, is it hard work! But Master Bernard raised me to try my best.. Apparently poodles are an uncommon mushing breed-!! I'm proud to say I've proved skeptics wrong.. ☆

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
I like to work hard with my squad!! The teamwork that goes into making sure we win.. every pup has their role here!

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
I-I get a little tired midway, admittedly..!! It's fun, but I have to push myself, more often than not!

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
Not really! I always anticipate the limelight, and I just love running with my squad.. We hype each other up! ♡

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
Looking at how hard my teammates are working reignites my flame.. It is surely not easy, but just by looking at them, I am reminded that we have each other!

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
I loooooove fashion!! Master Bernard used to take me to so many runway shows in my puphood.. I also model designer dog clothes with my lil sis!

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
I wake up and give myself about 30 minutes to wake up.. I'm not a morning person, sadly~ I then work on my hair a little bit.. Put in my barrettes.. and.. Oh! I like to eat a small treat~! THEN I'm ready to own the day!! ☆

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
I've had a very enjoyable time in both France and Russia!! In particular, I've felt very appreciated by our French audience..~♡♡ I'm blushing at the thought.. and such a fun night life!

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
I've been to so many different places throughout the world.. However, I long to visit Master Bernard's home in the Caribbean again the most! 

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I solely just want to make Master Bernard proud..!! He has given me and my baby sis such a life of prestige.. The least I could do is make him proud to call me his dog!

It also wouldn't be so bad to have a fruitful and pawesome modeling career~

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
Oh.. I personally feel comfortable as it is. I especially love Paris's little salon~ Really makes me feel right at home!!

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
I'd just like to thank them for all of their hard work and the sanctuary they provide us!! They are so passionate and loving~ Master Bernard entrusted me to the right musher.

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
I feel that they both carried their weight in their own ways!! Both pups have put in hard dedication, so I personally would not put one above the other..

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
We should go shopping and grab some lunch sometime to get to know each other outside of the heat of the race~♡

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Thanks for speaking with me~!! I'm going to meet up with my lil sis for lunch now. You should check out the cafe~ Have a nice day!!
