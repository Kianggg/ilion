<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
I'm Maya! The coolest dog in the Ilion Sanctuary!!

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
I love being part of Ilion! Even when I was a puppy, I knew that I was born to race and run through the snow. Ilion allows me to do just that! I can't imagine living anywhere else, it'd be way too boring!

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
Winning, of course! Just kidding~ Winning's fun and all, but I like working together with my friends, and Musher even more. There's nothing like helping the team leader navigate some tricky terrain!

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
I hate seeing Musher or my teammates sad. It's even worse when I don't know how to cheer them up...

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
I'm a born and bred sled dog so I never get nervous! I don't think I CAN get nervous... okay, maybe I get a little nervous if my teammates are nervous... but I'm always able to psych them back up before the race begins so it's really no big deal!

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
Knowing that everyone is counting on me makes it so that I can never give up!

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
I love tug-o-war! It's my favorite game! I'm the best at it and never lose, but sometimes I let Musher beat me because I like them so much. Racing is my life though so I'm always practicing with Mable and Yukola!

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
Every day starts off with a big breakfast! Then it's time for a game or two with the other dogs. If I'm lucky, Musher will join in!

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
I'm from Japan so obviously I have to pick it for my favorite place we've been to! But Russia and China are amazing too! It's almost hard to believe how big those countries are... it would take forever to run from one side to the other!

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
I wish we could have spent more time in Hokkaido so I could visit my hometown of Sapporo. I bet I'm really popular there!

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I want to make Musher proud! My main goal for every day is to get Musher to smile at least once... if only I could make it so that Musher was always smiling...

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
Musher should bring bigger branches and sticks for us to play with! 

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
Musher is perfect! If anyone complains about Musher they're gonna have to deal with me!!

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
Togo and Balto were team members who helped each other achieve the same goal! Why should they be pitted against each other?

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
We're gonna destroy you in the next race!! Watch out and get ready to eat our dust!!

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Is Musher going to read this?
