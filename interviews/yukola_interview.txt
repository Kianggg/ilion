Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!
I'M YUKOLA! ILION'S BEST RACER AND MUSHER'S FAVORITE DOG!!!! 

What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?
IT'S THE BEST! WE'RE THE BEST TEAM IN THE WORLD! 

What's your favorite part about racing?
RUNNING AND WINNING! BUT MOST OF ALL BEING WITH MUSHER!!!! 

What about your least favorite part?
NOTH- Ah...Hm... 
(Her ears went down, as if she's thinking hard.)
I hate it when Musher doesn't use me on the team, and I hate that I'm not a lead dog! How come stupid Tanya and Newfie are leads!? I'M A FREAKIN' RACING GENIUS!!!! 

Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?
I'm never nervous! I WAS BORN TO RACE! RACING IS IN MY BLOOD! IF I DON'T RACE, I'LL PROBABLY DIE! I DON'T WANT TO DIE!!!!! MUSHER!!!!! 
(She's screaming my ears off for the musher, now.) 

When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?
Winning, obviously! And~ Umm... 
(She's in deep thought again, but seems to be distracted by something. I asked two more times but she's looking around like she heard something. Moving on...)

What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?
My passion and hobby is racing! I can run all day and night! 
(She's very smug and confident.)

What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!
Run? We're gonna go run!? LET'S GO!!! LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO!!!!!! 
(She's jumping around and trying to take my phone.) 

You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!
I like it when we go to Russia, Cuz that's where I was born! And I get to show them who's boss!!!! I'm the boss of Russia! ME!!! YUKOLA!!! 

Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?
I don't care where we go as long as I'm with Musher!!!! 

Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?
I WANT TO WIN NADEZHDA!! AND I WANT TO BE LEAD DOG ALREADY!!! GRRR!!!! 

The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary? 
I think Musher should buy a bigger bed so that we can share it together! Because they never let me sleep with them! I want to take naps with Musher!!!!! 
(She starts crying.)

They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them? 
MUSHER, I LOVE YOU AND YOU'RE THE BEST! LET ME SLEEP IN YOUR BED!!! RARRGHHH!!!!!!

Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?
TOGO!!! TOGO IS THE COOLEST AND BEST!!! 

Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?
JUST CAUSE YOU GUYS BEAT US IN (She proceeds to list off 10 races that Ilion has placed low in.) DOESN'T MEAN NOTHIN'! WE'RE THE BEST!!!! THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!! 

Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up? 
AH!!! Sammy told me that she'd share her deer treats with me! SAMMY! HEY, SAMMY!!!
(She ran off...)
