<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
I'M YUKOLA! I’M ILION'S BEST RACER AND MUSHER'S FAVORITE DOG!! 


<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
IT'S THE BEST! WE'RE THE BEST TEAM IN THE WORLD! 


<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
RUNNING AND WINNING! BUT MOST OF ALL BEING WITH MUSHER!!!! <em>(My ears…)</em>


<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
NOTHI- AH... Hm...<em>(Her ears went down, as if she was thinking hard.)</em>
I hate it when Musher doesn't use me on the team, and I hate that I'm not a lead dog! How come stupid Tanya and Newfie are leads!? Grrr…


<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
I'm never nervous! <em>(She stands up.)</em> I WAS BORN TO RACE! RACING IS IN MY BLOOD! IF I DON'T RACE, I'LL PROBABLY DIE! I DON'T WANT TO DIE!!!!! MUSHER!!!!! 
<em>(She's yelling loudly for the Musher now.)</em>


<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
Winning, obviously! And~ Umm... 
<em>(She's in deep thought again, but seems to be distracted by something. I asked two more times but she's looking around like she heard something. Moving on...)</em>


<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
My passion and hobby is racing! I can run all day and night! 


<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
Run? We're gonna go run!? LET'S GO!!! LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO!!!!!! 
<em>(She's jumping around excitedly! Unfortunately, we’re not going for a run… Sorry!)</em> 


<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
I like it when we go to Russia, cuz’ that's where I was born, and that’s where I met Musher!!! I love Musher!!!


<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
I don't care where we go! As long as I'm with Musher!!!! 


<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I WANT TO WIN NADEZHDA!! AND I WANT TO BE LEAD DOG ALREADY!!! GRRR!!!! 


<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
I think Musher should buy a bigger bed so that we can share it together! Because they never let me sleep with them! I want to take naps with Musher!!!!! 
<em>(She starts crying loudly.)</em>


<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
MUSHER, I LOVE YOU AND YOU'RE THE BEST! LET ME SLEEP IN YOUR BED!!! PLEASE!!! RARRGHHH!!!!!! 


<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
TOGO!!! TOGO IS THE GREATEST!!!!


<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
JUST CAUSE YOU GUYS BEAT US IN <em>(She proceeds to list off 10 different races the team has participated in.)</em> DOESN'T MEAN NOTHIN'! WE'RE THE BEST!!!! THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!! 


<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
