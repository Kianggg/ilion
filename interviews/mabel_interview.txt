<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
HELLO!!! 
<em>(Clearly unable to hold back any longer, she begins to jump up and down, audibly bumping into the mic several times.)</em>
I'm Mabel! I like to wrestle! And run! And play tag! And-- 
<em>(She gets cut off by the next question.)</em>

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
I was SOOO super-super nervous when I started!!!!! You know?!?! I had to wear a harness and then I kept messing up and it was REALLY hard!!! But the other dogs helped me and were really nice so I'm ok now!!! 

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
RUNNING!!! 
<em>(Mabel flings her arms up, nearly hitting me in the process.)</em>

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Hummm...
<em>(Mabel gives a blank stare as she thinks. A drop of drool falls from her mouth after a lengthy pause.)</em>
I have to stay in line! That's really hard sometimes!! 

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
NEVER!!! I don't care about winning or losing! Every race is a win because I get to run with everyone for a REALLY long time!!!

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
I don't want to let the Musher to be sad!! The Musher was really REALLY patient and nice and helped me so I have to do my best! No effort wasted!! 
<em>(She gives a proud salute.)</em>

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
When we get new supplies I ALWAYS help carry it to storage!! It reminds me of when I lived on a farm! I pulled hay and food! I'm really strong, see? 
<em>(She pats her biceps with a confident huff.)</em>
And I like to take jogs and explore! But sometimes I go too far and I get lost, and Musher gets really mad at me!!! 
<em>(She starts wailing.)</em>

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
I wake up before most of the others and run! And then when I'm done running, I eat breakfast with everyone! And then I train! And then I eat lunch! And then I run more! And then-umm...What was the question?! 

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
<em>(She starts chanting as she jumps around.)</em>
USA! USA! USA!! ALL MY FRIENDS ARE HERE! 
<em>(Her smile is beaming.)</em>

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
I asked Musher where the Bernese mountains were once and they just laughed at me! I want to go to the Bernese mountains and meet the other dogs like me there!!!! 

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I want to run 1 million km--no!! 10 million km!! I want to run the farthest anyone has ever ran!!!!

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
<em>(Mabel adamantly shakes her head to the point of it looking painful.)</em> 

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
I LOVE YOU MUSHER!!!! THANK YOU!!! YAY!! 
<em>(Mabel pretty much has her mouth right up on the mic and she gives a double thumbs up.)</em>

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
TOGO! TOGO! TOGO! TOGO RUNS FARTHEST!!!

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
HELLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOO <em>(Howling)</em> !!! 
SEE YOU SOOOON, OK!!!

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
<em>(Mabel chomps down on the mic.)</em>
BYE BYE!!! <em>(It's muffled.)</em>
