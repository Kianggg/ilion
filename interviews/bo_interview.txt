<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Sure. My name is Bo. Uh… ain’t really much to say.

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
I like it here. I don’t really got any problems with anyone, and they treat me good. Musher is always fair. 

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
I like the hard work and being out in nature mostly. It’s easy to get into a flow when the scenery is nice. Aside from that… I dunno, it’s nice being part of a team.

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
It’s embarrassing to mess up in front of everyone. Sometimes feels like the harder I try not to, the more I do, so it’s best to just try to get in the zone and ease up… The weather gets kinda scary sometimes, too.

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
Yeah. I just try not to think about it. Sometimes if it’s bad enough I gotta ask for support… it’s kinda embarrassing though.

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
The scenery. Seeing everyone working hard around me, too. We’ve got some really talented dogs on our team.

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
I like to train; sometimes I feel funny about my technique, but when it’s going well enough it gets me out of my head. Musher encourages me to do fun stuff, too… so, sometimes I’ll wander and see what kind of things I can find outdoors. I like to watch the TV if my energy is low. It would be cool to have some kinda garden or crops to tend to.

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
I sleep for a real long time, wake up, go out and do some laps or lifting. Usually eat something after that, then find out if anyone needs help around the sanctuary. I’m pretty good at getting chores done, keeps me busy. Sometimes I’m getting in someone’s way rather than helping, though, so then I’ll go do something on my own. Train a little more, wash off, eat a bunch and then go to sleep. 

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Probably here in the US. China was pretty intriguing, too. Everywhere has its beautiful sights and quirks, everywhere’s got some kinda thing that trips me up. Quite a world.

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
I’ll go anywhere if the weather’s right. Some places get a bit too hot, but… would still be nice to go there, too.

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I think I’m already living the dream. Can’t get much higher than this.

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
We should grow our own peanuts.

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
I don’t got too much bad to say about the musher. They’re good to me. I want to do the best I can for them. 

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
Togo. All the way.

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Know your place, probably.

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Not really. Thanks for considering me.
