<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
I'm Hyoji... I race. Umm...
<em>(He flounders and trails off into silence.)</em>

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
I like it. Everyone is nice. I can run a lot and dig for as long as I want. I dug a hole right before I came over... It's over there. 
<em>(He points into the far distance. I squint but see nothing.)</em>

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
I like to be with everybody. Working together to win a race feels really good. I like everyone and Musher so much. It makes me happy.

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
When I mess up and ruin the momentum for everyone... and then I make even more mistakes. Musher says it's not my fault, but still...
<em>(He looks shamefaced.)</em>

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
Yes... Every time. If I feel too nervous, I like to hide in the snow or inside the blankets with Teddy.
<em>(He holds up a stuffed bear.)</em>
But I'm trying to get better at not worrying so much.

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
Musher's praise. Making the team happy... also the treats we can eat when we get back. My favorite is the one with peanut butter inside.
<em>(He starts wagging his tail just thinking about it.)</em>

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
I like to play hide and seek. And digging. Sometimes I like to dig while playing hide and seek. Even when I'm hiding for hours and nobody finds me. That's my favorite. 

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
Hum...
<em>(He's thinking hard.)</em>
I follow along with everyone else's schedule, mostly...

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
I like them all. I don't have a favorite. Do I need to have a favorite? 
<em>(He looks confused.)</em>

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
Well... I think if I dig for long enough, I can visit any place in the world.

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I want to become a good racer who never ever makes mistakes, and helps the team win races. Everyone will be happy together.

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
I like the sanctuary so much. This is my favorite place. 
<em>(He wags his tail and does not elaborate.)</em>

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
Musher is good. I feel so happy when Musher praises me. Thank you, Musher.

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
Togo.

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Oh. Hello. Hum... Good luck in the next race.
<em>(He does a small wave.)</em>

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Okay...I'm going to go back to digging.
<em>(He starts walking away before looking back.)</em>
You can come if you want.
