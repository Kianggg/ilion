<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Name's Olivier. I'm a Wheel Dog, which means I help keep the rest of these kids in line during the races. I've got more strength than what I know to do with, so it's the perfect position for me, I'd say.

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
To be honest... it's better than expected. Before joining Ilion, I wouldn't have given two hoots about sled dog racing, or whatever. Just seemed like a dumb thing humans came up with to use us dogs. But once I got thrown into it, I realized just how fun it could be... I get to exercise and eat a lot, and-- even though they're a rowdy lot-- I've made some pretty great friends. So yeah, being part of Ilion definitely beats staying at some run-down dog shelter. And well... the Musher's not so bad of a master, either.

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
Hmm... It's gotta be when we're right in the middle of it, the icy wind is blowing through my hair, and the burning in my muscles is enough to keep me warm...! Winning feels great and all too, but the journey is just as fun for me, heh.

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
<em>(She looks annoyed, and shudders.)</em>
Definitely the medical examinations. Not too crazy about needles or cold, metal things prodding at me.

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
It's all kinds of feelings. Nervous, excited... Stretching helps with releasing some of that tension, but I just gotta remind myself of how hard we all trained for this moment, that there's no way we'd lose!

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
Being Wheel means that I can see when any of the dogs in front of me might be having trouble. But it also means that everyone's trusting me to watch their backs, so I'd never wanna let them down. 
<em>(She says this next part quietly, only to herself:)</em>
And Musher's watching *my* back, so there's no way I'd fail...!

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
<em>(She smiles, as she counts things off with her fingers.)</em>
Tug-o-war, hiking, eating, chewing bones, rolling in mud... and I like bonfires, too.

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
Well, I think training days are self-explanatory, but other than that, I'm probably doing something listed above, or making sure Yukola isn't causing trouble somewhere.

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Snow is snow; I haven't noticed much of a difference between them. But ehhh, maybe Ger-Manny... Their apple strudels are pretty good.

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
<em>(She's struggling here.)</em>
...I'm not good with knowing this kind of human stuff.

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
Haven't really thought of it. I try not to worry much about the future anymore... I'm just enjoying what I have now.
<em>(She smiles, but it has a forlorn air to it.)</em>
But, err... I guess beating my personal weight lifting records is a goal.

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
LESS MEDICAL EXAMS!

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
I'm... not sure? They've done such a solid job with us. Though, I'm not sure when was the last time they went on a vacation or somethin'. So Musher, make sure you take it easy too now and then.

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
They're both important I guess... But I relate with Togo's strength of will more... And the Togo movie was pretty alright, too... 
<em>(Side note: she cried watching it.)</em>

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Don't underestimate us-- Or you'll regret it.

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Nah, but if you're done asking me dumb questions, I'm outta here.
