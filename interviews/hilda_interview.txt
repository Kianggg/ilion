<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Hello! My name is Hilda. I'm a Mackenzie River Husky from Virginia. I used to live at a ski resort as the resident mascot dog. I really like entertaining children, and eating lots of treats!

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
It's been... well, kind of an adjustment. As it would turn out, living in Alaska is a lot different than living on a ski resort. When I got here, I asked, "Where's the snow machines? In case it melts?"... I don't think they're ever going to let that go. And don't even get me started on the food restrictions!!
<em>(She wilts a little at that.)</em>
I've never seen so many dogs before in one place! But the one thing that is the same is that the dogs are loved here, just like I was loved at home. I always feel appreciated, even if I make a mistake. And I never even thought I'd turn out to have as much fun as I do racing!! It's like a whole new world for me.

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
I love seeing my improvement over time. It makes me feel so... cultured, doing all these races!! And I guess, it's almost a sort of instinctual feeling... feeling the wind in my fur, breathing in the cold, crisp air, my heart pounding; it's so, so much different than I thought it'd be, but in the best way possible!
<em>(Her tail is wagging a bit behind her!)</em>

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
I don't like waking up early. And I'm very scared of getting hurt!! Eep! My pain tolerance is not great..

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
Oh, absolutely. Sometimes I think I might throw up, so I eat some snow to feel better. I used to try to find some comfort in the other dogs, but like, some of them take it SO seriously!! You'd think they'd be set to be executed if they lost!!! I have to admire their dedication, but then that just makes me more nervous-- like, should I be taking it as seriously as they are? Am I just a casual who shouldn't even be here? Do they think I'm an INSULT to their CRAFT?
<em>(She shakes her head.)</em>
So, yeah, I like to eat the snow. And look at the clouds. 

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
Well... I don't want to look like a quitter in front of the other dogs! And I guess the feeling I get after completing a race-- it's such a satisfying, empowering feeling... I try to remember that when the going gets tough.

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
I really like watching birds. And chasing them! But I promise I'm good at watching, too! I'm a very patient dog. And then... Hmm... I guess I'm trying to work on my social skills with the other dogs in the meantime. But it's hard when they're so intimidating, and experienced, and much cooler than you, and you keep getting their names mixed up!! Sigh... Oh! But I love the summer tours!! I love love love talking to people and spending time with them and bla bla bla bla bla--
<em>(She continues to ramble on about how much she likes socializing with guests for a minute or so before I cut her off.)</em>

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
I'm pretty typical! Other than training, I spend a lot of time on my own loafing around or socializing with visitors. My favorite thing to do is pretend to let them teach me a trick-- I must have learned "roll over" from about 20 different people by now!! I also enjoy a good game of fetch!

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Oh! Ummm.. Well, Canada reminded me a lot of home. I saw lots of interesting birds!! But no northern cardinals... I guess they don't fly that far up north... I guess I'm a bit of a homebody. Nothing beats Ilion!!

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
Can I tell you something?
<em>(She looks dead serious and leans in.)</em>
You must not EVER tell the others. I didn't even realize that there could be mountains bigger than the one the ski resort was based on. I mean I saw pictures and heard of other places, but I guess I just sort of. Didn't believe it? 
<em>(She's cringing at herself.)</em>
Okay, that sounds so stupid. I was so sheltered, okay!! I lived on that mountain my whole life!!! I didn't knoooooowwwwwwwwww...
<em>(She trails off into a despairing whine...)</em>
But, umm... Maybe I'd like to go somewhere tropical? 

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
Oh, oh yes!!
<em>(She lights up and excitedly wags her tail.)</em>
I really, really want to start a family someday!! But, I realize that I still have some growing to do before I can be responsible for so many tiny lives... So for now, I'm working to improve myself through racing. I'm not sure when I'll be ready for motherhood, but I'm sure I'll know when it's time!

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
I think we should start a summer camp program for the babies. Then, I will get to play with the babies all day and give them rides, and they will love me most. They can have lunch time and I'll eat all the food off the floor. I am a very good, responsible nanny dog and can do this, so please consider.
<em>(She's got a sort of matter-of-factly, business proposal air about her now...)</em>

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
I think that I should get more food options outside of our normal diet and menus. Okay, so maybe table scraps aren't necessarily GOOD for sled dogs... But I miss them sooooo bad! I used to have bacon, eggs, pancakes, sausages, burgers, bagels, donuts, meatballs, cupcakes, spaghetti, ice cream... People would give them to me aaaaaall the time!! Musher... pretty please make an exception for me?? I won't tell the others!!
<em>(She's putting on her best puppy dog eyes!!!)</em>

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
Oh, ummm... So, I maybe only recently learned the story about this recently... I know Togo is the real hero, but... All the kids at the ski resort used to call me "Balto" when they were too young to know my real name!! I grew up knowing Balto, so I feel a bit of bias... is that bad? Am I a "poser"...?
<em>(She looks a little troubled.)</em>

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Please go easy on us!! ... Hmm... that was probably a lame thing to say, huh... 
<em>(She looks a bit awkward.)</em>

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Do you want to see my "spin" trick? I'm really good at it!!
