<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Hello, my name is Gau. I have been apart of Ilion's racing team for sometime to get a new fresh breath of air from my previous occupation. Outside of the races, I tend to the sanctuary's garden and help with the cooking. 

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
My time at Ilion has been nice. I try to find a good balance in training myself for each race and finding time for myself. Racing has given me the competitive discipline I've been missing for quite sometime. The company with my other teammates has been fun too. 

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
The adrenaline and coordination when you're out on the field. 

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Hm... Can't think of one other than waking up early to train. 

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
There are times why I do get nervous before the race... the fear of messing up. But before I let me thoughts get to me, I start to do jumping jacks and slap myself awake to realign myself with reality.

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
The feeling that someone I knew would be proud of me.

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
As I mentioned before, I tend to the sanctuary's garden and help cook the meals. Aside from that, I like to go for walks.

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
I wake up, tend the gardens, and then prep any ingredients for the meals. After that I go for a walk on my own to clear my mind. Then, I'll come back and do my training for the day. Once that is finished, I go to the kitchen and make the meals for the day. After dinner I usually go for another walk before coming back and heading to sleep.

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
I liked racing in Canada. It is where I was originally from, and there are certain aspects like the mountains and the vast greenery that makes me feel calm.

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
Tibet would be a fun country to visit. The culture and the vast range of mountains are nice. I heard the Yeti lives there.

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I'd like to live on a farm with someone I love.

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
More plot for gardening because everyone has such a big appetite. 

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
I think Musher should stop worrying about our rival's musher and focus on themselves. 

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
Balto.

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Hmmm.... good luck? I know the team has a lot of competitive spirits, but I myself am not the type. However, I do think its good to foster a healthy, competitive environment in this kind of space. 

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Daikon radishes are a cool weather crop, so they can be planted in spring for an early summer harvest, or in late summer for a fall harvest. To grow them consistently, moisture is key. Don't let it dry out, or you'll get pithy, pungent roots. At the same time, don't let it get waterlogged, or the roots will rot. A drip irrigation system is a great way to achieve this.
