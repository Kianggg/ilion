<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
My name is Hina. I am just a normal dog. I like racing.

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
Being part of Ilion has been a dream come true! 
<em>(Her tail is wagging excitedly.)</em>
There wasn't any opportunity for me to race on the Big Island. And no friends to race with... well, no dogs, at least. 
<em>(Her ears droop, and her tail stops.)</em>
Oh, but there are plenty of cool racers here! Even if I'm still getting to know them...

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
My favorite part about racing is feeling like I'm part of a team. I raced and trained on my own for so long. My friends encouraged me to work hard and race every day, but it's just not the same as being around other dogs who like to race.

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Getting my fur all dirty! It's THE WORST.

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
I get nervous before every race, no matter how big or small it is. I play cheerful music to get me ready. It makes me feel like I'm an epic hero.

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
I think about how hard I worked to get here, and how long and scary the trip was on the container ship to get to Alaska. If I could do that, I can push through anything!

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
My hobby is eating yummy food. My passion is passion fruit!

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
In the morning, I wake up and listen to rock and roll, or pop. Something sweet. Then I eat something sweet. If it's available. Then I train. Then I walk around and try to work up the courage to talk to some of the other dogs. Usually this is unsuccessful. Sometimes I'll pop my nose into the cafe or the clinic. Sometimes I'll go over our schedule. I like to know what races we'll be doing well ahead of time, so I can plan. My day is a mix of all those things!

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Switzerland was nice because it was very, very mountainous and green. It made me feel like I was at home in Hawaii. Also, I stole a chocolate from a street cart. I vomited it all back up immediately, but it tasted great on the way in. The Musher scolded me and told me that chocolate is bad for dogs. Now I know...

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
I would love to visit the other Hawaiian islands. I wonder if they're same same as the Big Island. Or different. Are there mountains there that have snow?

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I would like to try being a lead dog. Don't get me wrong, I love being a team dog, and I'm very happy with my role on the team. But when I first joined, there was the possibility I might be a lead dog. But I just turned so red! I got so embarrassed! I hate being put on the spot. So it's a matter of pride now. I gotta get over my shyness.

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
Let me eat sweets!

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
No, everything is perfect! I love the Musher! I'm still indebted to them so much after they took me in when I showed up totally unannounced!

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
I'll be honest. I never even heard about Togo until I joined Ilion. I know that Togo is the "real hero" now, but I just can't forsake my Balto. There was a tee-vee special on Balto that played on repeat in a local restaurant back in Hilo... I musta seen it hundreds of times. I grew up idolizing Balto, so... Team Balto for life!

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Good luck, and may the best dogs win. And that's us. We're the best dogs.

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b> 
Thanks for chatting with me...!
