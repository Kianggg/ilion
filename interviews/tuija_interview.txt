<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Hello, I'm Tuija, and I'm currently affiliated with Ilion. 
<em>(She looks at me with a determined look.)</em>

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
I'm eternally grateful towards my Musher and the whole team at Ilion for taking me in when I was at my lowest... I've received nothing but love and happiness during my time here.
<em>(She looks downwards. I can tell she's turning a little bit red by her eartips...)</em>

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
The feeling of comradery after finishing a race... being surrounded by my beloved teammates!
<em>(Her eyes sparkle as she leans forward enthusiastically, clenching her fists.)</em>

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Sometimes the cold wind does make my skin rather dry... 
<em>(She scratches a bit at her cheek covered by her mask.)</em>

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
I don't feel nervous anymore... I know how to race professionally. So as long as I do it right, then nothing can go wrong.
<em>(Her eyes look onward with a stern glare...)</em>

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
With my team and my dear Tulirevot near me I feel like I can win any race... I'm so thankful to have them by my side.
<em>(Her eyes light up as she talks about her team and her fanclub.)</em>

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
I like to collect skincare products and cosmetics, and I like doing my own make-up too. 
<em>(Now that i look at her... she does look very well put together...)</em>

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
I wake up quite early, around 4-5AM. First, I go for my morning run, and after I return to the kennel I do my skincare routine. When others start waking up I like to join them for breakfast... After that, I cannot say, as my daytime and evening schedule can change depending on if we have a race that day or not.

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
I love racing in the Scandinavian countries as it makes me think of home...
<em>(Her eyes look away... She looks a little emotional... She continues.)</em>
Of course, South Korea was also very interesting as it was quite the culture shock for me and a few other dogs!
<em>(She giggles. The mood lightens up a little.)</em>

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
As I mentioned earlier, South Korea caught my interest... I saw some interesting skincare products there... I would like to return some day for leisurely activities. 
<em>(She really seems to love her cosmetics...)</em>

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I want to be a great sled dog who wins lots of races... I want me and my team to do their absolute best in every race.
<em>(She seems extremely serious, with her sharp gaze.)</em>

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b> 
I'm happy with how things are at the moment... But if I must, I would like to suggest more training gear... A gym, perhaps?

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
I like my Musher just the way they are, I wouldn't change a thing... They are the most kindhearted friend I have... I want to support my Musher in the same way they support everyone at Ilion.
<em>(She looks downwards, shyly.)</em>

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
Hmm... Pitting two amazing sled dogs against each other... 
<em>(She furrows her brows as she holds her chin, pondering. She continues.)</em>
...I will have to choose Togo this time, as his team ran a much longer distance.

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Yes. Team Ilion is going to beat you, I'm certain.
<em>(She looks determined and proud.)</em>

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b> 
I'd like to thank you for your time, and thank you for the interview. 
<em>(She's smiling gently, even though her mask is covering her mouth... I can tell from her eyes.)</em>
