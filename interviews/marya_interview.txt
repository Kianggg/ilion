<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Marya. 
..........
<em>(She stares as if she's finished answering.)</em>

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
.....It is nice to have a home and a pack to call my own.

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
Running makes me feel like I am out on a hunt..... I like to feel my heart race, and the wind against my face.....

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
.....When something interrupts our running.

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
I do not get nervous. Each race I participate in, I give it my all. So why would I doubt myself?

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
Musher, and my pack. I want to do my best for them.......... 
<em>(She has been pretty direct and expressionless, at least up until this point. Her ears twitch a bit and she looks down a bit shyly.)</em>

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
.....I like to go out into the trees to enjoy some peace and quiet.

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
Wake up, eat, run, sleep.

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Russia, because I know the land there well.

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
No. I'm happy where I am.

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
My only goal is to be the most loyal to Musher and my pack.

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
I want Musher to let me hunt for my own food..... It tastes better that way.

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
<em>(She looks into the camera like she is talking directly to the Musher.)</em>
Do not be afraid to push us harder. We are strong, and we will be able to take on anything. 

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
..........What is that?

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
You will fall. 

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
No.
