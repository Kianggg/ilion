<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Hai~! I'm Trace! Umm. I came to Ilion a little bit ago, and uhhh... Well, I'm new to it, of course, but I'm excited to learn more! My favorite things are music and fashion! <em>(She fluffs up her hair with her hands and then shows off an insane amount of accessories. Her accessories make me feel nostalgic almost!)</em> O-oh, and the musher, obvs!


<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
It's totes amazing! It's, like, a dream come true! Really! I have everything I need, and a musher who loves and cares about me and my needs. I couldn't ask for more. It was a little hard adjusting to racing at first, but now I'm getting a little bit better at it, I think!


<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
Making my musher happy!


<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Umm... I'm a little shy around the other dogs, but I'm working on it... I worry about not fitting in. I already feel like I don't...


<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
I'm always nervous. Like, race or not. I'm nervous right now, actually. Uh... but anyways, I usually go to the musher for reassurance. Remembering who I'm in it for always helps! The other dogs sometimes try to help me too, but... It just makes me more anxious...


<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
Making my musher proud! And showing the other dogs that I'm, like, totally capable and really trustworthy and cool... And stuff...


<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
I love dressing up, like SOOOO MUCH! If racing wasn't my thing, I'd totes be a model or something! It's fun putting on stuff and seeing how it looks, and it's even more fun getting pics taken! I wish I had some with me to show you...


<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
Umm, it's not very exciting, but that's how I like it. I kind of go with the flow and do whatevs. I try to stay underfoot of the musher whenever I can. If they're not around, I usually keep to myself and only participate in stuff if I'm, like, asked to. Which... surprisingly happens often... Oh! I also need to have my hair brushed very thoroughly every day. That's important!


<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Well, Japan was interesting. The language was very new, but it sounded cool. Plus, the girls there have really cute fashion! Makes me wanna dress up like that. 


<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
It'd be nice to go back to where I came from, wherever that might have been. It's less about, like, the location and more about the people... no, person. It's lame. Sorry, this answer is lame... <em>(She seems bashful, but the answer was very sweet to me!)</em>


<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
Well, going off my last answer... I want to become world famous, so famous that I'm like, on every TV ever, so I can reconnect with the girl who raised me. She'll have to see me if everyone out there is seeing me, right?


<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
Umm... I think we have it really great here. I can't see how someone could ask for more...!? I sort of came from nothing so having a salon and everything else right here is, like... unreal! <em>(I’m so happy she thinks so!)</em>


<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
Oh! No... they're awesome, there's nothing they need to do better! Really! Just spending a little time with me every day is enough. Okay, maybe... Um... I'd like a little more time with them? Please? Just to help me acclimate even more? I-I promise I'm not avoiding talking to the other dogs...


<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
Balto! I sometimes see cool edits of him online! Like, the kind that's a bunch of videos stitched together to music! ...Wait, that's not actually him?! It's just a movie based off of him!? 


<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
<em>(She shrugs.)</em> Umm, good luck...! I guess...? I'm sorry, I'm not very competitive...


<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Umm... I hope to make everyone proud! And stuff! Please believe in me. <em>(We believe in you, Trace!)</em>
