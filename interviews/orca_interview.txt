<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Finally, my turn. Orca. Ilion's best racer, and future lead.
<em>(He's trying to keep a straight face but can't help but throw a gloating smirk to Tanya off screen, who gives him a double thumbs up.)</em>

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
It's been good. 
<em>(I waited for him to elaborate further, but he stopped there.)</em>

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
Winning.

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
I won't name names, but let's just say there are some incompetent members on our team. It's just annoying when they slack on training and inevitably drag us down on race day. I mean, have some respect. The Musher does so much for us. Anyways, I won't get into it.
<em>(His arms are crossed. By some miracle, he looks even more pissed than before.)</em>

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
Never. Pure, focused, adrenaline on race day.

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
Trusting myself and knowing I can push through, no matter how hard it gets. There's always more you can give. If you think you're tired, grit through it and give 110%. You have to remember it's all in the mind.

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
I go to the gym daily. I also just graduated, so I have more time to train now. My diploma hasn't come in yet, but I finished at the top of my class. 
<em>(He looks really smug.)</em>

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
Wake up at 6, go for a light jog. Breakfast. Gym. Shower. Big lunch. Sometimes read a bit, sometimes go for a walk in the woods. That's pretty much it. 

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
If I were to choose a favourite... Finland is like sled dog paradise. We stayed at a place with a sauna, right next to a huge frozen lake. Have you heard of contrast hydrotherapy? 
<em>(He doesn't wait for a response.)</em>
It's amazing for inflammation and muscle soreness. I've read it also has some detox effects since it stimulates your lymphatic circulation. We need a sauna here.

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
I don't know, maybe someplace tropical. I've never seen a sandy beach. Usually in colder biomes all we get is rocky beaches. Would need a haircut though. 

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
Win Iditarod.

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
Maybe more quiet solitary areas. Also a sauna.

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
No! The Musher is incredible. They're the best in all of Alaska. 

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
This argument is so tired, but obviously Togo.

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Not really. 

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Make sure to watch us at <em>(upcoming race).</em> It'll be streamed on TV.
