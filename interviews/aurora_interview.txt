<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
You're welcome... 
<em>(She bows her head in a short nod. Her expression was a little bit stiff and, at least at the start, talked very languidly.)</em>
My name's Aurora. I'm a lead dog for the sprint team and... Yeah.

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
It's nice... It's been nice. 
<em>(There was silence for a while. She looked like she was deep in thought-- I noticed that this happened a lot throughout the interview. Just as I was about to move on to the next question, she spoke up again, this time with more of a fast-paced fervor.)</em>
When I was first taken in by the sanctuary, I really wasn't sure about it at first. I wasn't sure about a lot of things at that point in my life. Being away from home, and then suddenly being thrust into competition with the idea of me being a lead was... Definitely an upheaval. One I didn't feel like I was prepared for at all, I guess. I had no prior experience in that position, let alone racing. I earnestly thought I didn't have it in me. But still, everyone has been so accommodating. My effort bore fruit and... I guess it's strange to say it, but I feel like ever since I've joined I've felt nothing but happiness... and pride in myself. It really does feel like me and all of the other dogs in the sanctuary have been set up for success. Now, it's like I have two homes in a way. It's nice... 
<em>(She looks lost in thought again, but jolts back.)</em>
Um... Sorry. You can move on to the next question.

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
...It's hard to explain. Erm... let me think for just a second...
<em>(I gave her a minute.)</em>
It's like, there's this coursing rush throughout my entire body whenever I race. It's like every part of myself is working in unison. Whether it's following a set trail at our quickest pace or making those short split second decisions to help guide our the team on the fly, there's always something preoccupying me. Racing and the feeling it gave to me just came to become a second nature to me... H-hopefully that makes sense... Mhm mhm.

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
Um... 
<em>(She looks a little bit distraught trying to think of an answer.)</em> 
I, uh, can't really think of anything that I dislike about racing... Sorry. Well, rather than that, I guess I shouldn't be sorry for that, it should be a good thing to find nothing but joy in it but-- er, anyways, yeah. I don't think there's anything I dislike about it.

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
Yes, I do... Very much so. It's always the lead up that's the most difficult for me, and I'll admit that when I try the usual deep breathing and stretching to get myself psyched up, I tremble a bit. But all of those feelings go away the very moment we start.

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
There have been a couple of times... When it gets really tough, I... 
<em>(She pursed a smile-- the first time I saw a different expression on her face. She was looking at me but it was as if she was staring at something far, far away.)</em>
Well... I just think of someone. That's all. 
<em>(I didn't want to pry.)</em>

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
Um... Well, I like to hike the nearby trails... It's nice to camp outdoors, as well. Especially at night. Especially in the wilderness... Ah! You know, actually, speaking of the wilderness, I love setting off to explore it on my own-- sometimes I ask for a day off the day prior so I can set off at night to see the northern lights. Musher wasn't sure about letting me off at first but after sneaking off enough they just let me be, gahahaha. There -is- a light curfew in place, but curfew schmurfew, honestly. 'Cuz really, nothing beats snacking on meat and a little bit of whiskey under the night sky! OH! Oh yeah, look, look, look at this, I have a harness specifically for climbing as well, they even got it custom made for me--
<em>(She showed off her harness. She went on about outdoorsmanship for a while. Her tail was wagging wildly.)</em>
AND ALSO, ALSO... also... I guess I... 
<em>(Her glance turned to me for a while, and it seems like she noticed how much nodding I was doing while she was speaking so passionately about the subject.)</em>
Um, I guess I write and sketch a little bit too.

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
I put myself through a lot of training... Sometimes very early in the morning, too. I don't mind it, but there are a lot of times where I'm... uhm... lacking in sleep for being out and about too late.
<em>(As a brief side note, she told me specifically to omit that part of her response in the case this interview were to be shared with Ilion's musher.)</em>
There's a few breaks here and there to eat, snack, and play, but it's usually in the evenings I go hiking about.

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Sorry if it's a bit of a boring answer but... Canada. I know we're neighbors, but it's still my home country... But especially now, when I race there, it just feels like I have the most to prove.
<em>(She chuckled to herself under her breath. She looked quite smug and fond of herself.)</em>

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
I love the idea of travel and seeing more sights, but I already get really homesick sometimes when we travel worldwide to race...
<em>(She pauses for a bit.)</em>
Although, I do know... someone... who'd love to tour all of Western Europe in the summertime... But they can't. They talked about this massive train system, too, and it sounded nothing short of amazing. I think I'd like to go... I'd have to ask Kima to help take plenty of pictures.

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
Seeking victories is nice, and we do have medals to our name, but in all earnesty... I'd want nothing more than to help around the sanctuary and teach a new generation of Ilion sled dogs when the time comes... A-although, something like that won't come for a while! It's far too long before I retire, of course!

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
Huh? Musher asked? T-this is a little out of nowhere, isn't it? Uhm... I'm really no good at pointing out faults or what to improve on unless it's something incredibly obvious, so... If anything, and it's a bit embarrassing, so...
<em>(It seemed like she kept swallowing-- she might have been holding back drool.)</em>
Bigger servings of food after training would be good... I-I mean, I understand completely if that can't happen, but... You know...

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
...More than anything, and I say it a lot already, but I want to say nothing more than "thank you" to Musher for everything they've done for me, and done for us. That's all.

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
?!?! IT HAS TO BE TOGO, OF COURSE!
<em>(She started listing off Togo's accomplishments and heroics, and how she confided in the very notion of an unsung hero, and essentially reiterated of all the stories she was told of him back in Canada.)</em>

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
<em>(Her ears perk, and she started to break into laughter.)</em>
Gahahaha! I guess it'd be good to say something here, no? In that spirit of competition and all that... Something like...
<em>(She made this weird stance and started talking in a low voice all of sudden. It did take me a bit aback.)</em>
"...Good luck, because you'll need it. We will not lose." BAHAHAHA--gh, sorry, sorry, um... I never really get the chance to say something like that, so I--

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
You're welcome, and thank you as well. Sorry if some of my answers were a bit strange, uhm... I'm not used to interviews like this. Maybe there's something I can ask you to do for me, though, if you're interviewing sled dogs-- 
<em>(She brought me aside and told me about a small town in the neighboring Yukon territory to bring some gifts and a sealed note back to. Overall, it seemed like Aurora warmed up a lot as the interview went on. What a lovely girl! It was almost hard for me to believe it at first, but I think I understand why she was chosen to be a lead for her team.)</em>
