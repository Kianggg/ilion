<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Hello, I'm Newfie, from Newfoundland, Canada. I'm a sled dog for Ilion.

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
It's nice.. I've made a lot of friends so far while at Ilion and enjoy racing alongside everyone.

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
Being there with everyone and enjoying the moment, and helping out those who need my help during a race.. it makes me feel like I'm really part of a team. 

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
I often get really distracted during racing... it's hard to stay focused sometimes.

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
Yes, all the time... I'm worried that I might not be as good as the other dogs... I resort to my secret brandy stash to keep me comforted and calm my nerves. 

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
Seeing all the other dogs perform and try their best really inspires me to keep going, even when I feel like giving up... Also, I um... enjoy having some nice brandy and treats as an end reward to the races.

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
I enjoy taking a lot of naps and making toys or sculpture carvings out of wood. I also help the Musher out at the clinic sometimes because of my past experience as a rescue dog. 

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
I um... Wake up and eat. Then I do training with everyone. I take a nap during training *by accident,* and after that I take another nap. Then I eat again, and after that I help Musher in the clinic! And then... I... I forget what else.

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
France for sure... Their brandy tasted really good. 
<em>(He begins to drool.)</em>

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
Um... I think maybe... uh... um... uhm. I need more time to think about this.

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I guess... to be a good team member during racing... I don't want to be the perfect racing dog, but I wish to preform well with the rest of the team!

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
I'd love a personal brewery... The scent of brandy has always been my best friend during my time as a rescue dog and I'd love to have an infinite stockpile of it.

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
Nothing at all!!! The musher has changed my life and is perfect the way they are.

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
<em>(He was about to answer, but he saw a squirrel and got distracted...)</em>

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Please leave us alone... We dont like you!! 

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
No... I'm gonna go take a nap now.
