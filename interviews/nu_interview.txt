<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
Yeah, whatever. Let’s get this over with already. My name is Nu and, I dunno, I like curry bread, I guess. It's like one of the few things that keeps me excited nowadays, honestly. And… Uhhhh– that’s it. 
<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
<em>(He scoffs.)</em> Everyone here is a talentless scrub! I could care less about this place, do you have any other interesting questions? Well, I mean, I guess there was a period where all of this was fun… But that feeling is all gone now… <em>(He looks off to the distance, almost looking sad. Kind of dramatic if you ask me.)</em>
<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
Favorite part?? I mean, like I said, I find racing to be a big waste of time now! But… I guess that feeling of connection to my teammates and rivals, the hours of practice turning into an indescribable bond, and everyone aiming for the finish line, and–<em>(He’s getting overly excited and talking fast now–Trying to transcribe, but…)</em> –and when everyone comes together with one goal, one mindset!! That connection and spirit!!!! Ahem….Next question. 
<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
This sport! Next! <em>(He’s dismissive now, he seems to be embarrassed from showing his excitement for racing.)</em>
<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
Nervous?? What's there to be nervous about after training and pouring countless hours into this!? Dogs that get nervous clearly haven't prepared enough. If you’ve done that then you should feel confident and have no need to feel nervous! At least, that’s how I feel… 
<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
.... My teammates… <em>(He whispered this.)</em>
<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
Hmm… I like bread… Curry bread… Red bean bread… Pizza buns… Yea, bread… And… <em>(He says something here in a hushed voice– Sounded like “Electra”. She’s a lead dog from a famous rival team.)</em>
<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>


I wake up and the first thing I do is some morning stretches, you know, basic foundational movements and all that. That goes on until breakfast–If I get the chance, I like to watch footage of the best rival teams while I’m eating, you know, to make sure I’m up to speed with where they’re at. Then afterwards, I like to stalk– I mean– check out the conditions of my teammates as well. <em>(I heard he likes to stare at them and make snide remarks about their forms and habits.)</em> Then, when we’re not training together or doing stuff together as a team, I like to wait ‘till everyone is asleep so that I can go for a nightly jog to make sure I’m in peak condition! Don’t get the wrong idea though, I could care less about this sport! 
<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
Probably Japan… Their convenience stores had… So much…Bread, oh my…. 
<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
Not really, as long as I get to be with my team and my.... Ahem…. <em>(He looks off into the distance. He must be thinking of someone…Perhaps Electra again?)</em>
<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>


I don’t have any grand goals like that. I simply want to beat the top team and get the attention of… Tsk, anyways…
<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>


Hmmm… Maybe some more lights around the trail and kennel. It gets snowy and dark during the fall and winter, and it can be dangerous for us dogs practicing or hanging out late at night! 
<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>


More bonuses and rewards like curry bread! <em>(This is the most serious he’s been during this interview.)</em> 
<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>


They’re both great racers– Togo was the ace and was one of the best sled dogs of all time. Balto was also amazing and took charge during the last stretch of the Serum run. There’s a lot of dogs here that like to argue and pick a favorite, but they were both incredible at the roles they were given! <em>(A surprisingly normal answer.)</em>


<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
….No….Just wait…. 
<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Nope! Have a good day! And uhh…. No one’s gonna see this interview, right? I’d like some things to be kept private……………
