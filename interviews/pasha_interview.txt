<b>Hi! Thank you for letting me interview you. First thing's first. What's your name, and tell me about yourself!</b>
I'm Pasha! I'm Ilion's big sister!! Hrm... I... um... I'm Ilion's BIGGEST sister!!

<b>What's it like being part of Ilion? How has your experience been?</b>
I'm so happy!! And my little brothers and sisters are happy... I'm the happiest big sister!!

<b>What's your favorite part about racing?</b>
All my cute little brothers and sisters around me! Pasha can watch over them all-- and when I see everyone running and happy together... big sister is happy too!!

<b>What about your least favorite part?</b>
I can't see everyone behind me... Hmm... maybe if I swap place with Musher... But I don't want to be alone! And Musher doesn't run... I want to run!! Eh, but I want mMsher to run with us too.. Hrm... I wish I had more eyes behind my head, then I can see everyone! I should get 300 eyes so I can look at everyon--

<b>Do you ever get nervous before a big race? How do you usually feel beforehand? And if you do get nervous, how do you psych yourself up?</b>
I'm never nervous... because I'm big sister! Big sister has to be strong for everyone!

<b>When races get difficult, what inspires you to keep going?</b>
When it's difficult... if we finish quickly, we can go home and eat! I wonder what's for dinner today...? 
<em>(She has a faraway look in her eyes as she starts drooling.)</em>

<b>What do you do outside of racing? Any hobbies or passions?</b>
Passion...? Hrm.. Musher said I'm not allowed to eat the "passion"... But I really love meat! Yukola told me there are many different kinds of meat- water meat, flying meat, meat that runs really fast, jumping meat... My favorite is the red meat. So juicy!! 
<em>(She's drooling again.)</em>

<b>What's your daily life like? Give us a run down!</b>
Run? We run a lot!! A LOT! Not just for racing! We also sleep a lot, and eat, and play... I love to play with my little brothers and sisters! We always have so much fun together, sometimes they're even laughing or all smiling at me even when I'm not even doing anything! They must be very happy to see me too!

<b>You've been to races all over the world! Which country has been your favorite? Tell us about your time there!</b>
One time, Musher took us to this place with soooo much snow and SO many deer!!! We chased them, and later, Musher fed us red meat! Actually, it was a darker red meat, and it was more chewy than normal red meat... but, it was soooo delicious! 
<em>(It sounds like she's talking about Finland, or it could be northern Sweden or Norway where Sami people keep deer, I'm not so sure...)</em>

<b>Outside of racing, is there any place in the world that you would like to visit?</b>
Hrm... I will go anywhere! Traveling with everyone is so fun! And I get to see more cute little brothers and sisters everywhere!

<b>Do you have any ultimate goals or dreams that you'd like to achieve?</b>
I want to be the world's biggest sister! I will eat a lot... I will even train a lot to become bigger!! And then... everyone will play with me, because I'm the biggest, and big sister said so! 
<em>(Note: She's actually the 2nd tallest dog at Ilion.)</em>

<b>The musher has asked me to ask you (and the team) if there are any suggestions or improvements you have in mind for the sanctuary?</b>
Sometimes, the others will take food from my bowl and run away quickly... Did Musher put something special and extra yummy in my food?! I hope everyone can get yummy food too! Hrm... OR Musher could get Pasha a bigger bowl... then I will have more food to share for my little brothers and sisters!

<b>They also asked me what they can do to improve themself to be a better musher towards you and the team. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?</b>
Pasha loves Musher, everyone loves Musher! Musher is the best!! One day, I hope everyone can look up to Pasha the same way too!

<b>Now for the big question: Togo or Balto?</b>
Hmm... are those the names of my new little siblings? Big sister is excited to meet them!

<b>Anything you'd like to say to Ilion's rivals?</b>
Ilion is better than you!! Because... because I'm Ilion's BIGGEST big sister! And I said so!!!!

<b>Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions! Is there anything else you'd like to say before we wrap this up?</b>
Did Pasha do good?! I hope I did good! Do I get any treats?! Ohhh, I wonder what's for dinner again...
