&emsp;&emsp;Nora was a shepherd dog that was treated terribly by her owner due to her lack of self-confidence and clumsiness while herding sheep. She wasn't necessarily scared of the sheep, but she would constantly doubt herself when making decisions. Whenever she would make a mistake, or a sheep would escape due to a slip-up, she would be rashly punished. Her owner would constantly tell her that she would be replaced with a better and brighter dog. Nora didn't want to be abandoned, so she made it her goal to try harder. But nothing was ever good enough for her owner. Nora gradually grew weary, and before she knew it, any hope she had in ever being good at herding sheep was pretty much nil. But above all, she didn't know if she could take the punishment she got for it anymore. She decided to escape from the cruel grasp of her owner and ran off into the mountains to start a new life-a life for herself.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Her freedom alone felt like it was enough to keep her running on forever at first. However, winter quickly arrived, and the blistering cold quickly wore her back down. She barely made it out on her own until she was luckily found and rescued by rangers. The rangers took her into a nearby town and dusted the snow off of her. They didn't know what to do with her; she had no collar, no tags, and the location they found her was far from civilization. They suspected she was a stray, so they decided to put her up for adoption. But quite a bit of time passed, and no one came to claim her. To generate interest, they made new posts, now writing that she was a brave dog, a rare breed capable of surviving the harshest of blizzards. A musher from Alaska who had been visiting their friend in Sardinia came to the ranger station, and to their surprise, expressed interest in adopting Nora. The rangers snickered to each other as they retrieved her for them, believing the musher was a na√Øve fool, giddy that someone fell for it. It didn't matter to the rangers; they were just glad to get her off of their hands finally.<br>&emsp;&emsp;When they arrived at the sanctuary in Alaska, Nora confessed to the musher that she wasn't good with cold weather at all and that the rangers had lied about it. The musher told her that they already knew. Truth be told, when the musher had seen her pictures on the posts, they knew something was off and wanted to help her immediately. After some time, Nora decided to join the mushing team to repay them for their kindness. At first, she felt a bit out of place and awkward, falling into the old pattern of doubting herself and her abilities. But unlike her previous owner, the musher was incredibly patient with her, which finally allowed her to flourish and grow to show off her true potential.

&#x1F43E She's a mushroom connoisseur and likes to hunt them when it's in season. She also likes searching for asparagus and goes for bird game as well.<br>&#x1F43E The garment that she wears is a mastruca; a goat/sheep skin that sheepherders in Sardinia wear. The term mastruca is of Nuragic origin.<br>&#x1F43E She also sometimes wears a cowbell across her chest called a marratzu.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;"Sardinia is my favorite place to visit in Europe, and I know Nora misses it a lot. She's told me so much about the culture there and of the old Nuragic ruins. She gets passionate when she talks to me about it, which makes me happy because when I first met her, she was timid and shy. She felt bad for me because those rangers "tricked" me into thinking she was a winter dog, but I already knew she wasn't! And it wasn't her fault anyway. Even if she's not a winter dog, it doesn't matter to me. Her safety was all I cared about. When she first started racing, she had difficulty adapting to the cold, which caused her to lose motivation. I knew her lack of confidence stemmed from her bad experiences with sheep herding, so I came up with a plan! I don't own sheep, but dogs are close enough (Right?). For a while, I made Nora round up the dogs whenever it was time for certain activities or bedtime. Some of the dogs thought it was a game, which made it challenging for Nora. But she eventually got the hang of it, and now she's an expert dog herder. This boosted her confidence a lot, and her performance in racing improved tremendously! If given a chance again, I know she'd be the greatest sheepdog that Sardinia has ever seen!"
