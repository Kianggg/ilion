Aurora, named "Thistle" at birth, was born in a small town in the Yukon territory of Arctic Canada to a prolific competitive sledding team family.<br>Inquisitive in her youth, she loved the sights of the Arctic more than anything else, and was keen to join her siblings in cross-country races as a means to participate in competition and see even more of the world. When it came time to put her abilities to test, however, it was decided that she was not fit for the team, much to her dismay-she was the runt.<br>Rather, it was deigned that she was to be the companion to the sickly first-born child of the family, who was originally thought to be the one who was to carry on the title of the key musher for the family, and the one who would continue their legacy of competitive sledding. Due to their health, this wasn't possible. Aurora was distraught—to her, it felt like a stinging irony for the runt to be stuck with someone who she could hardly view even view as an equal. It was as if the two of them were brought together only because they were both failures. Her self-confidence was dashed, and she would often lash out not only at someone she viewed as lesser, but also out of her own self-perceived inadequacy.<br>Yet, her sickly companion would always, without fail, outstretch their hand. They would often take Aurora sledding on hikes, and she would not understand why or what for. It wasn't until she caught a glimpse of the beauty of the northern lights in the wilderness that she remembered what she really cared about from the start. This was when her companion gave her the name "Aurora." What started as deep seated resentment later turned into a greater sense of respect over the course of these hikes. They learned more from their companion—traversing the arctic, survival, and all sorts of practical things. They learned their companion shared in the appreciation for the natural world that she had, and journaled these thoughts surrounding the subject constantly, and although taken aback at first, Aurora grew a greater appreciation for the craft, and gained a sense of worldliness.<br>These idyllic days and nights would not last forever, though. Aurora's companion would deteriorate further, to the point where these hikes were no longer a possibility. Wanting for Aurora to be with other dogs, to see more of the world, and to give her another chance at a life of competition-- one that they couldn't have due to their sickliness—entrusted her to a friend, the Ilion musher. They left Aurora with a personal journal to remark about all the sights, to one day bring back for them to read. It became her most treasured keepsake. She never shares this journal with anyone else because of the personal message left for her on the first page of the journal—a message that gave her the absolute resolution to pursue something greater for herself at the sanctuary.<br>

"Aurora's owner and I had met ages ago as kids cause our grandfathers were long time friends and mushing rivals. I remember their grandfather's dogs and how impressive they were, and how my grandfather would jokingly gloat about how he always won against him. Before they became sick, Aurora's owner had declared me their rival and said we'd both race each other when we were older; just like our grandfathers. At the time, I wasn't interested in mushing and only wanted to take care of animals, so I had laughed off their declaration many times. Even though the memories are something I cherish, I can't help but frown due to the circumstances that my old friend has had to face over the years. Now we couldn't be the rivals they wanted us to be, especially now that I'm a musher. That being said, this made it even harder for me to accept Aurora from them, and I knew she didn't want to part ways with them either. In private, her owner had told me about her past and what a wonderful dog she was. I believed she was wonderful without a doubt, but seeing Aurora run for myself made the story of her being born a runt almost too hard to believe. She's an incredible racer; tenacious, observant, and not to mention fast! She truly was born for this sport! I'm so proud of her and how far she's come since her arrival here. I try to keep my friend updated about her as much as possible. They're just as proud of her as I am, and grateful that I've given her the chance to finally race; but I'm the one who's grateful! Thank you for allowing me to give her the chance to—You two together would've made formidable rivals!"
