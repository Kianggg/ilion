NAME: Canela<br>BREED: Samoyed<br>FROM: Spain<br>POSITION: Team<br>TEAM: Mid-distance<br>ARTIST: <a href="https://twitter.com/g76952964">Leo</a><br>
&emsp;&emsp;Canela was raised by a very strict owner who trained her to compete in dog shows. She lived a very privileged lifestyle and was spoiled rotten. But despite the frills and indulgence, she felt very lonely. She felt like her owner had no real love for her and only saw her as a pretty object used for winning competitions. After some years, Canela's owner lost all of their money due to several terrible financial choices. They packed up their belongings and disappeared, leaving her behind. Luckily for Canela, news got out about her owner's scandals, and rescue workers quickly came to retrieve Canela to bring her to a dog sanctuary in Barcelona.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Canela was a bit self-absorbed during her stay at the Barcelona sanctuary, always wanting to be the center of attention. There weren't many things to do there, either. So to keep herself entertained, she had to get creative. She began pulling and pushing heavy objects to show off how strong she was. The workers at the sanctuary joked about how she'd make a great sled dog, not knowing that this would be such an accurate prediction of her future. The Ilion musher was visiting a friend in Barcelona, where they decided to visit the local sanctuary-as they always make a point to do while on trips in other cities. Canela wasn't familiar with mushing, but she had heard that someone was visiting the sanctuary to adopt a dog, so she began to show off her strength the way she usually did in hopes of being chosen. The musher caught sight of her and was charmed and impressed by her power. Unable to resist, they immediately adopted her.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Canela was so excited to finally be under the care of an owner again. But she didn't realize she would be living in such a snowy environment, somewhere completely foreign to her. But as a Samoyed, she was built for this. Once there, she quickly began to prefer it over Spain's hot and dry weather. Canela had never been part of a team before. Growing out of her self-absorbed nature spurred from being a show dog took some time. But eventually, she learned that her contributions to the team were just as important as anyone else's, and she quickly grew to love her team and her new home at the Ilion sanctuary.

&emsp;&emsp;"With how strong and talented Canela is at pulling, you would think she's a natural-born sled dog. But her beautiful fur is proof of her show dog days! And even after rigorous training sessions and multiple races, she still maintains her soft fur like it's nothing. When Canela first arrived, she was very distant from the other dogs and didn't like sharing anything with them. She would often refuse to work alongside the others. But as time went on, she began to open up, and she became one of the most active dogs on the team. It wasn't easy placing her on the team at first because she proved to be good at every position. And whenever she's needed, she steps in immediately! This is a significant difference from how she was initially; she used to completely ignore us when things went wrong! It makes me happy to know that she cares about us like a family and is willing to take on the lead position when needed. Yes, you read right! Lead position! She's even a capable leader, but the reason she's not a permanent lead is that she doesn't like to bear too much of the responsibility. She'll only step in as a substitute if one of our other leads is not feeling well. Otherwise, she's usually a team dog, but she occasionally gets placed as wheel and swing too! She's truly a jack of all trades!"
