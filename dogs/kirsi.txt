&emsp;&emsp;Kirsi was born to a litter of sled dogs and was the smallest of her siblings, making her the runt of the bunch. This left her in a precarious position when it came to being a candidate for adoption. How could a dog so small have any pulling ability? However, Kirsi wasn't discouraged by her stature one bit and ended up training hard for much of her younger years. She was determined to build up her stamina and speed as much as possible in preparation for her future.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Through the years, many potential mushers came by to see the litter searching for a new addition to their team. Each time, Kirsi would become over-eager to prove her worth to them and to stand out-and more often than not, she would only make a fool of herself. She took up an â€˜act now, think later' attitude, ever desperate for recognition. When she'd pull something, she would pull strong but then slip and fall over. If she tried to run fast, she'd do great but end up tripping. Usually, this kind of clumsiness was seen as typical for a young, inexperienced dog and was never that big of a deal. But because of her size, potential adopters would turn away regardless and leave with someone else each time.<br>&emsp;&emsp;She was willing to do better, but nobody gave her the chance to. All of Kirsi's siblings were adopted until it was just her, left to be nothing but a common pet dog. She never lost her way and continued to train, still hoping to improve, still hoping for that one small chance to roll along someday. Eventually, that day finally came. A musher from Alaska came by the household in hopes of adopting one of their dogs, but when they arrived, they were told that there were no more available; they'd all long been given away. Before they could leave, the musher caught sight of Kirsi pulling in the backyard and quickly took an interest in her. Her owners, somewhat embarrassed of the truth, told them that she was certainly capable of being a sled dog but that nobody wanted to adopt her because of her size, so they decided to keep her as a pet.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Kirsi prepared herself for another rejection, but her ears stood tall on her head when she heard the musher exclaim that they wanted to adopt her. The owners were grateful that someone saw her potential for once and allowed for the musher to take her home. At last, all of her hard work had paid off. She made her way back to Alaska with them, where she finally got to find her place on the Ilion mushing team.

&emsp;&emsp;"Kirsi is one of the smaller sled dogs in the sanctuary, but performs as amazingly as everyone else and is one of the sweetest dogs around! It's tough to believe that all of those potential mushers overlooked her due to her size. They act as if she's a Pomeranian or terrier when she's far from it. Any dog born to be a sled dog should be given a chance to race if they want to, and Kirsi has proven herself to be one of the best. Her energy and determination are uncontested, and she's always the first one up and ready for practice, even on days when there's no practice. I honestly believe that without her, my sprint/mid-distance team wouldn't win as many races as it does. She has this natural ability to energize everyone around her, which comes in handy during the last stretch of a race. That type of ability almost made me consider her as lead dog for the team, but unfortunately, she's quite hasty when it comes to listening to commands. If we keep practicing commands, then one day, she might lead the team to victory on her own! So I won't completely write off the possibility for her, as she's always defying the odds!"
