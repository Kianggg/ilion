&emsp;&emsp;Cheremsha was one of the former lead dogs of musher Akhill. Originally from a small village in the Sahka republic, she was chosen by Akhill for her exceptional endurance. She had won many long-distances races in her time, including the renowned but notorious Beringia race.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Due to an accident, however, Cheremsha was retired and was given to the Ilion sanctuary for rehabilitation. Currently, she is not set to race anytime soon, but the staff here at Ilion are devoted to her and are working closely to ensure that Cheremsha has the chance to race again! We hope to one day share her story with fans of both her and Ilion more in the near future, once all has been resolved.
