&emsp;&emsp;Cheremsha was born in a remote village in the Sakha region of Russia before becoming a lead dog to the Siberian musher, Akhill. Akhill was told that Cheremsha’s endurance was unlike any other, capable of working from sunrise to sundown without breaking a sweat. Akhill had been searching years for a lead dog that would help her win the famous Beringia race and felt that she had found one in Cheremsha. She adopted her, and shortly after, she placed her as her team’s sole lead. Despite Cheremsha’s lack of prior sled dog training, Akhill had full confidence that her drive and charisma could lead a team of champions the world would know.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Her intuition was correct, as Cheremsha helped the team bring home first place in that year’s 2,100km Beringia race in record time. Many believed it was a stroke of luck, but Cheremsha’s role as a lead dog became her life’s focus. Her self-discipline and passion inspired the other dogs on her team to follow her with great confidence. Led by her charisma, they continued to bring home first place wins in various long-distance competitions. The team’s winning streak shattered previous records, causing them to strive for even loftier goals. Cheremsha’s strength as a leader grew as she developed a deep bond with her teammates and always looked out for them; constantly reminding them to take it easy and not overdo it. Yet heavy was the crown, as she would bear all of the responsibility of winning and push herself to the limit. Whenever she ran, it seemed like she had no limit, and everyone, including herself, truly believed she didn’t.<br>&emsp;&emsp;On another fateful 2,100km Beringia race, the frigid Siberian weather took a turn for the worse, causing many teams to be set back. Not wanting to jeopardize the team's safety, Akhill sought out shelter for everyone to stay in. Cheremsha was not deterred by the storm and believed they could win despite the sub-zero blizzard. Her team and musher begged for her to stay, but she disregarded their pleas and promised them that she’ll get them to the finish line safely. After much hesitation, Akhill allowed for the team to continue. She trusted Cheremsha, as she had never let them down before. She guided her team through the treacherous weather, and she proved herself a worthy lead once again by getting the team across the finish line in first place; another record broken.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Yet, this victory did not come without a cost. Cheremsha’s health plummeted severely, and she collapsed due to over-exhaustion. After many examinations, veterinarians concluded that Cheremsha had pushed herself too far, causing near-fatal damage to her body. Her mind could not accept her new limitations, as even standing would leave her gasping for breath. Led by guilt and responsibility, Akhill decided to retire Cheremsha from the team. Akhill took her to the Ilion sanctuary in Alaska, where she entrusted her to her good friend, the Ilion musher. There Cheremsha has focused every day on growing stronger in hopes of regaining her strength.
