&emsp;&emsp;Roann is an ex-show dog, winning best in show three years in a row at various dog show competitions worldwide. Her winning streak made her quite popular in the dog show world, but because of this, the stakes grew even higher, and her trainer became increasingly strict over time. Since the competition rules would change every year, her trainer would often end up taking matters over the top. One day she grew sick of it all and snapped, and on the morning of an upcoming competition, she mauled her trainer as revenge.<br>&emsp;&emsp;She was immediately banned from participating in any more dog show competitions and was sent away to a pound. Roann didn't seem to mind the consequences; after all, she was now free from all the rules and unrealistic expectations. But the pound was dreadful, and since she had mauled her trainer, she was essentially unadoptable. What she thought would be an easy escape from her troubles ended up putting her on death row. Just when Roann had started to grudgingly accept that it was the end of the road for her, she learned she was adopted by a musher that had come from Alaska to see her. Supposedly some of the dogs at the musher's sanctuary were fans of Roann, and when they had heard about the incident, they decided to bring her in.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It felt like nothing short of a miracle. Roann finally got to relax peacefully at the sanctuary; no more competitions or dumb rules to follow! But she'd be lying if she said she didn't miss the thrill of winning. After some months of living at the sanctuary, she took an interest in the sled team and decided to give it a try. While there were still rules to follow, they weren't ridiculous like dog show rules, and it's definitely a lot more fun.

&emsp;&emsp;"Even though my whole life revolves around dogs, dog show competitions feel like a whole different world. If it weren't for the other dogs begging me to watch it with them, I would've never known about Roann! We followed her shows pretty closely because she has this way of presenting herself that's very captivating. In the beginning she was skeptical of joining the team, but she really loves winning competitions, so she gave it a try. While training, it was obvious she struggled with following instructions. She also got annoyed at the other dogs pretty frequently. It was obvious she was still bitter about her old owner and the entire incident, and so I tried my best to be patient with Roann. I gave her a lot of space, and the other dogs also increasingly encouraged her. This eventually rubbed off on her, and she started to follow everyone like a natural born sled dog. Just like her dog shows, her pulling abilities are outstanding! If it weren't for the fact that she randomly decides to stop listening from time to time to my commands, I would've made her a lead dog-she's that good! And despite being banned from competing in shows, her previous fans have been following her races and have been cheering her on. She acts like she doesn't care that much, but I know it means a lot to her!"
