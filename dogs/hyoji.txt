&emsp;&emsp;Hyoji was a gift to a newly wedded couple in celebration of their future together. The newlyweds were totally unprepared for how much extra work a puppy would quickly end up to be, but they decided to keep him anyways. For a while, the little family of three got on much better than they’d initially expected. But as incompatibility between Hyoji’s owners began to emerge through the trials and tribulations of daily life, the bubble was inevitably burst before any of them could really settle into it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;As he grew, so too did the chaos. The fights between the couple became increasingly frequent and worse each time, eventually leading up to an explosive breakup and several legal battles going forward. The two people Hyoji cared about the most were now at odds with each other—and try as he might to alleviate their pain, his presence appeared to be more of a burden than a thing of comfort. When the whole calamity finally rolled to its end, Hyoji was dropped off at a dog shelter, never to reunite with his owners again. Everything that had happened had molded Hyoji into a very shy individual, his self-esteem in the dumps. It took a certain amount of energy to get anyone to notice him that he just didn’t have. His long, lonely stay at the shelter seemed to drag on forever.<br>&emsp;&emsp;One lucky day, by some miracle, Hyoji was picked up by the Ilion musher during their visit to South Korea. After his transfer to Ilion Sanctuary, he quickly found himself fascinated by watching the other dogs race on the sled team. It didn’t take long for him to gather up the courage and ask to join. Now he’s a permanent part of the team; a hard working asset that shines bright despite his reserved attitude, healing by the day.

&#x1F43E He likes to be outside and will follow the other dogs around, sometimes annoying the other dog in the process.<br>&#x1F43E He likes to dig holes in the snow for long periods of time, sometimes to the point where he is unable to get out and has to be assisted by the others.<br>&#x1F43E He carries around a teddy bear that he likes to chew on, and hides it if he isn't able to take it with him.
&emsp;&emsp;"I was surprised by how active and energetic Hyoji is, given that he's incredibly shy. Like many of my other huskies, he has a natural talent for racing. But unfortunately, he's way too hard on himself when he makes a mistake. Sometimes the mistake wouldn't even be his fault and he'll still blame himself for it. He tends to dwell on these minor things for too long to the point where it affects his behavior. Whether it's not being fast enough, not turning in time, listening to instructions wrong; he perceives it all as something wrong with him. I try to reassure him all the time that it's not true. Personally, to me, my dogs never make intentional mistakes, because it's my duty as their musher and owner to guide them on the right path. So if it's anyone's fault, it's mine. But making mistakes is part of growing, for both humans and dogs, and in the end neither of us should beat ourselves up over it. And if I have to remind him of that a million times more, then so be it cause I hope one day he'll see what I see in him– an incredibly hardworking and talented sled dog!"
