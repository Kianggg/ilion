NAME: Alto<br>BREED: Samoyed/Rough Collie Mix<br>FROM: Palmer, Alaska<br>POSITION: Team<br>TEAM: Mid and Long-distance<br>ARTIST: <a href="https://twitter.com/foxglovens">Mikky</a><br>
&emsp;&emsp;Alto was born to a litter of four; her father was a rough collie, and her mother, Tosca, was a samoyed. All of Alto's siblings were adopted except for her, allowing her to grow up close with her mother. <br>&emsp;&emsp;Tosca was a former sled dog, and –while not particularly famous– her team did gain decent renown. Alto would spend her days running with her mother, who taught her everything she knew about racing. She loved every second of her daily routine; running and playing with her mom during the day and curling up in bed with her owner at night. For Alto, this was the true meaning of happiness.<br>&emsp;&emsp;One quiet morning, their owner left to go for a hike as she usually did on the weekends. All seemed to be fine until their owner failed to show up that evening. At first, Alto thought maybe she was just running late. But then days passed, and she still had not returned home. Tosca felt it was her duty to look for her, so she and Alto left to search through the vast Alaskan wilderness. The search was challenging and grueling; Tosca often sacrificed her food and energy to keep her daughter alive as it was wearing Alto down just as much. After a week of searching, they eventually ended up on the side of a highway, where a concerned onlooker pulled over and picked them up. Learning of what had happened, the onlooker told the two that their owner was most likely dead; after all, the Alaskan wilderness was treacherous and unforgiving. This revelation broke the two, but they had to accept the harsh truth. The onlooker dropped them off at a shelter, where they were kept in a small, cramped enclosure. <br>&emsp;&emsp;The treacherous journey proved to be too much for Tosca, and she knew she didn't have much longer. Staying close to her in her final days, Alto swore to her mother that they would get out of the shelter and be free again. The following morning, her mother passed on. Overcome with grief, Alto found the strength to break out of her enclosure and run away as far as she could.<br>&emsp;&emsp;As she ran, she felt as if her mother was beside her, which gave her the strength to go on for miles. And through a stroke of luck, her legs gave out at the exact moment she had reached the Ilion sanctuary. The Musher quickly found her and took her in to nurse her back to health. When Alto woke up, she was energized and opened up to the Musher about everything that had happened; her owner disappearing and her mother passing. Despite the tragedies she had faced, she explained to them that it felt as if her mother guided her to the sanctuary; it felt like a sign. Alto decided to stay at the sanctuary, regaining her strength and eventually recovering emotionally from the loss. She learned about the Musher's sled team and felt like it truly was a blessing from her mother. Through this, Alto joined the team and found a new place to call her home.

&#x1F43E She's a bit absent-minded if she’s not directly engaged in an activity and tends to stare off into space<br>&#x1F43E She loves music and playing instruments thanks to her previous owner <br>&#x1F43E The musher gave her a heated blanket because she has difficulty sleeping without the warmth of another dog (She still likes to sleep next to others)<br>&#x1F43E Her favorite food is salmon and pig ears <br>&#x1F43E Developed CEA (Collie Eye Anomaly) at a young age. While she isn't fully blind, her vision is poor in her left eye, so she learned to rely on smelling/hearing. Thus she tends to run with her eyes closed.
&emsp;&emsp;"Alto is a very talented racer, but due to her eye condition, I have to give her regular check ups, especially leading up to a race. Thankfully, she's learned to keep her eyes closed during races—but even so, I can't help but feel anxious sometimes, considering how unpredictable the weather can be. I'm sure I come across as irresponsible to the other mushers for keeping her on the team, but removing her would crush her. She's been through so much and racing is incredibly important to her. I try to find solace in the fact that there have been other visually impaired dogs in racing history that were able to race just fine—in fact, Alto adapted to her condition much faster than the rest, and I'm really proud of her! Anyways, I'll stop being so dramatic because as long as she's under my care and is happy and smiling, then she can race to her heart's content!"
