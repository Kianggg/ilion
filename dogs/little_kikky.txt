&emsp;&emsp;Little Kikky was the smallest born to a prestigious female lead dog named Burgundy Thunder the Third and is owned by the world-famous fashion designer Bernard. As a child, Bernard would often join his parents on Alaska-centric business trips that would go on for weeks at a time, where he would be under the care of a family friend named Michi, who had a great passion for mushing. One winter, Michi invited Bernard to watch her participate in a mushing competition. Bernard was reluctant at first-after all, he wasn't a fan of Alaska's frigid weather at this time of year, and he was starting to miss his home in the Caribbean. However, he eventually gave in and tagged along. While he was there, he got a chance to see Michi's Burgundy Thunder the First lead the team to victory. From that point onward, Bernard became a huge fan of mushing.<br>&emsp;&emsp;When Bernard had grown older, he found his place in the field of high fashion design, where mushing came to be a primary muse of his. He designed a few lines of dog gear and apparel catered towards sled dogs and their mushers. He continued to keep in touch with Michi and later adopted Little Kikky, who came after a couple of generations of Burgundy Thunders. Bernard cherished Little Kikky and took her with him all over the world. She was given a life of luxury and went on to be the face of many high fashion and pet magazines worldwide. But one day, news came that Burgundy Thunder (the Third) had passed away, and Bernard decided to retire temporarily. Compelled to have Little Kikky carry on her family's legacy, she would live life as a prized sled dog and not just a pampered pooch.<br>&emsp;&emsp;He moved to Alaska, where he was interested in starting his own mushing team, but even with Michi's help, he couldn't seem to find a way to get established. Michi suggested entrusting Little Kikky to her good friend at the Ilion sanctuary. Bernard wasn't too sold on the idea initially, but Michi had never let him down before. Once introduced, Bernard and The Ilion musher quickly became friends, and Bernard's confidence in allowing Little Kikky to be part of the Ilion team grew solid. At first, Little Kikky was scared of messing up due to her inexperience, but she didn't let this deter her. She had a goal, after all, and that was to continue on the Burgundy Thunder legacy!

&emsp;&emsp;"When Bernard brought Little Kikky over for the first time, he gave me so many supplies and a long list of do's and don't's. I was okay with it, but I was very panicked on the inside. He's understandably protective of her, and I didn't want to make any mistakes cause the life of a sled dog can be hard at times. But once he left, Little Kikky told me to throw the list away and treat her the same as everyone else- not wanting any special treatment. I sighed with relief and told her I would do that. She's a delight to have around, and all of the dogs love her! They're always curious about her travels, as she has visited dozens of famous cities. She said that she would convince Bernard to take us on a European staycation or something like that. Which sounds fun, but I can't imagine how expensive it's going to be with 24+ dogs. I guess we'll get to that bridge when it's time to cross it (or however the saying goes). Oh, and another thing, Bernard insisted that I make her a lead dog in order for her to continue on the Burgundy Thunder legacy. But after many training sessions, I came to determine that her position would be team dog. Again, I got scared of how Bernard would react, but Little Kikky reassured me that she wanted me to place her on the team honestly."
