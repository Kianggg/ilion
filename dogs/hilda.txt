&emsp;&emsp;Hilda came from a fairly average upbringing for a dog, being born in a small shelter with her littermates. Unfortunately, her litter came down with parvovirus and was moved to a foster home to recover. Despite the foster's best efforts, only one puppy survived. The foster had formed a bond with the little dog and decided to adopt her, giving her the name Hilda. Her new home became Winterhop Ski Resort, which her adopter owned and managed. There, she became accustomed to the snow at a young age and met many different kinds of people. She became a mascot for the resort, and spent her days charming guests and racing across the hills. Hilda was especially beloved by children, who were also her favorite guests to interact with. Extremely tolerant, she had no issues with loud or handsy toddlers clambering over her. This is where Hilda first dipped her paws into sled-racing; with the very humble beginning of pulling children around!<br>&emsp;&emsp;Hilda's owner noticed her natural stamina and excitement when racing or pulling in the snow, but didn't nurture this passion much during their time together. Her world quickly changed when her owner retired and began the process of rehoming her. Hilda felt betrayed, but would later realize that her adopter was getting old and was planning to move somewhere where she would never have the opportunity to explore her greater potential as a sled dog. As Hilda had given the ski resort a bit of following on social media, the owner sent out a plea for any potential adopters who would take over her care and training—that's when the Ilion musher stepped in! After seeing Hilda on their feed a few times in the past, and reading all about her, the arrangements were made, and she was off to Alaska!<br>&emsp;&emsp;Hilda is still adjusting to sled dog life. She is used to a carefree lifestyle of all-you-can-eat dog biscuits, naps by the fire, and constantly being doted on. She is noticeably more squishy than the other dogs, and not the best at making friends—but makes up for it with her determination and upbeat attitude!

&#x1F43E She could nap the day away if given the opportunity<br>&#x1F43E She loves interacting with tourists and guests that visit the sanctuary—Showing them an abundance of southern hospitality and charisma!<br>&#x1F43E When interacting with other dogs, she tries to be "hip" and socialize. Some of the other dogs feel it's a bit (in their words) "cringe".<br>&#x1F43E Dreams of one day being a mother, but romance flusters her too much!
&emsp;&emsp;"I once visited the Winterhop Ski Resort many years ago for a short snowboarding trip during my college years—This was before Hilda was there. So when I saw on their social media that they had adopted a new dog and had made her the mascot, I quickly followed them! All of the posts made me want to visit the resort again, but with school, then graduating, then opening my clinic and kennel, I found my free time really limited. So I was disappointed when I found out that the owner had made a post about closing the resort down—but when I saw that he was looking to rehome Hilda, I jumped right to the opportunity! Hilda's experience as a ski resort mascot helps a lot when visitors and patients come to the sanctuary. She makes everyone feel welcomed and occasionally helps those struggling with stress—which is very handy when patients come in with sick pets. I've thought about asking her if she'd like to become a certified therapy animal, that way she could visit different facilities around town, but I've been so busy it keeps slipping my mind. But when I think about it again, I think she's happy doing what she's doing at the sanctuary. And given the fact that she prefers taking naps, it's probably better for her to just stick to one place instead of traveling around multiple times a day. So I'll ask her again when I feel like it's the right time. Until then, thank you for all your help, Hilda!"
