&emsp;&emsp;Before speeding down a snowy path, Kamira was an esteemed dog model—Her thick, soft coat and willingness to listen to instructions made her famous within the modeling industry. Many photographers considered her to be the picture-perfect model for their shoots. Over the years, she lost interest in her career and became bored with everyday life. All of her accomplishments and prizes came too easy for her within the industry, and it all became meaningless to her; she needed something more. She wanted to see if she could do something challenging, something that would make her heart race from the neverending excitement.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In a twist of perfect fate, Kamira met the Ilion musher—They saw her interview about wanting to do things other than modeling. They reached out to her in hopes of giving her a new challenging opportunity in life. When Kamira learned about sled dog racing, she became ecstatic and joined without hesitation. She would never admit this to her old owner, but she secretly loved getting dirty and playing. Many years ago, she would go into the woods during family outings and play in the snow, making her owner angry. Now at Ilion, she was able to express that puppy-like joy as much as she wanted!<br>&emsp;&emsp;Kamira got the challenge she had been looking for as racing proved to be more challenging than she had anticipated. But with her strength, ability to follow orders, lots of training, and support from her teammates, she eventually became a "model" sled dog (pun intended)!

&emsp;&emsp;"Due to Kamira's previous occupation as a model, she was already experienced in being confident and motivated. But although she enjoys a good challenge, she underestimated how difficult sled dog racing could be. She admittedly came in headstrong and made many mistakes in the beginning (which is completely fine, whether you're a beginner or veteran!). Thankfully, instead of letting that get her down, her resolve to improve only grew stronger. She was confident in her skills and ability to improve and never once let her mistakes during practice define herself as a sled dog; at least, that's what she wanted others to see. She tried not to show it, but I could sense that Kamira was struggling to ask for help. Whether she wanted to admit it or not, she was still new to the idea of being a team player. I think this is because she wanted to keep up the perfect image she was used to when modeling, and was too embarrassed to admit when she needed help. And so, no matter how many times she told me, "I got this," I continued to give her my support in any way I could. And I'm glad I did so because Kamira eventually picked up and learned from this. Now, she's improving every day, and she’s not afraid to admit when she needs help! I'm proud of her!"
