&emsp;&emsp;Olive is a former blue ribbon show dog, renowned for her luxurious coat and well-kept, immaculate appearance. During her time with her previous owner, a handful of posts featuring Olive alone were enough to have their [Instagram] account booming, with each installment going viral soon after posting. While it was a good thing at first, after being preoccupied with beauty for some time, Olive ultimately grew bored with it, and with the simplicity of her career. She began to yearn for a new ambition, a new skill to hone in on. She wanted to be more than just a spectacle.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It didn’t take long for her owner to catch onto the shift in energy; Olive just didn’t seem to have her heart in it anymore. After a little bit of soul-searching, Olive confided in her owner that she wanted to try her hand at agility; a weak point of hers, but an interest nonetheless. As good as they had it, her owner wanted her to be happy. They ditched the pursuit of glamour together and worked to find a way to make Olive’s wish possible.Through asking some friends for advice on where and how to train, Olive's owner learned about Ilion sanctuary and how their sled team is usually open for new trainees. Oblivious to the intensity of sled-dog racing, they contacted Ilion's musher and signed her up to join the team.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Needless to say, Olive wasn't exactly prepared for the rigorous training at first, but she adapted very quickly and never once gave up, even when it got tough. While difficult, it felt natural. With her shining ambition and tenacity, it wasn’t hard for Ilion’s musher to see Olive's great potential as a sled dog. After her first few weeks of training, the musher made an agreement with the owner to put her on the team full-time. Olive, always loving a challenge, happily complied—with the condition that she’d get to visit the dog spa at least twice a month.

&#x1F43E She's one of the tallest dogs at the sanctuary (6'2")!<br>&#x1F43E Favorite foods are fresh, raw tuna and eggs. (They are good for a dog's shiny coat!) <br>&#x1F43E She's usually grooming herself, or braiding/accessorizing another dog's coat during her downtime.
&emsp;&emsp;"Thanks to Olive and many of my other ex-show and model dogs, I've come to appreciate the dog beauty world. I've slowly been gaining knowledge on it, and I even took a few classes! But because of my busy schedule, I never completed the certification, so I only have surface-level knowledge. Show dog competitions are no joke; many of my dogs who participated in them can tell you about their rigorous training regimes from those days. But even though they're highly competitive and challenging, they're not the same as sled dog racing. There's a high-risk factor in racing, so I get anxious when I have an ex-show dog transitioning into the sport; because there tends to be an issue with over-confidence. That being said, Olive has significantly improved since her arrival. One might say it’s thanks to her husky side, but Olive has proven time and time again that she has the determination and power to overcome any obstacle thrown her way. Even when there was danger, she was never too scared and pushed forward like it was nothing! Because of how hard she and the others have been working, I feel inspired and plan on finishing my dog grooming certification. Wish me luck, Olive!"
