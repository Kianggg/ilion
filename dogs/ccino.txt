&emsp;&emsp;Ccino was born to a large litter of rescue dogs destined to offer protection and assistance, but with the rapidly declining population of her home, she and her siblings had little use. She tried to look on the bright side—It was good that humans weren't in danger! But her home felt lonely, and it was heartbreaking to know that her beautiful home, once sprawling with life and culture, was disappearing. Push came to shove, and the association she was born to sought out adoptees who could utilize their skills. That is when Ccino met the Ilion musher, who had been visiting friends in Japan. She wasn't too thrilled about the prospect of going to another cold region, but the desire to help those around her burned like a little candle in her heart that could easily melt away ice. It was then that she decided to go forward with moving to Alaska and left with the musher. <br>&emsp;&emsp;Ccino never thought the winters could get any worse, but she was proven wrong the moment she arrived in Alaska. Thankfully, the frigid cold was overshadowed by the liveliness of the sanctuary. She found it comforting—This was the type of life she wished her old home had. It was bittersweet to know that there was no way things could change for the better there. With a heavy heart, she shook her head and told herself she would no longer look at the past. From then on, she would enjoy her new life at Ilion.

&emsp;&emsp;"I don't think any other dog at the sanctuary despises the cold as much as Ccino. Some dogs here aren't naturally adapted to the winters-- In fact, some dogs are from hot regions, and yet they love winters more than her. But unsurprisingly, if emergencies happen outside in the freezing cold, she's always the first one out there! One time, Yukola escaped into town looking for me during a blizzard, and Ccino brought her safely home. That was one of the few times I saw her initial training as a rescue dog in action. After much thought, I approached her and asked her if she wanted to work at the clinic. That way, during her down time, she could have something to do and stay warm. She happily obliged and got to work almost immediately. She's a great help around the clinic, and her knowledge of first-aid is impressive. Next time I take a trip somewhere warm, I'll be taking her as a thank-you for all her hard work!"
