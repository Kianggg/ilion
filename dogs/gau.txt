&emsp;&emsp;As a young pup, Gau was brought up on a farm, where he spent his days doing various farm chores, herding cattle, and whatnot. The farm's owner passed away some years down the line, and Gau was adopted by one of the owner's close friends who worked at a nearby coal mine. Gau was then trained as a mining dog, helping miners with various tasks that required a good amount of pulling strength. During this time, Gau befriended a fellow dog named Bona, who also worked in the mines.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Bona was a former explosive detecting dog who was retired and rehomed after suffering minor injuries while working. While he was supposed to live a comfortable life, he became a nuisance to his owners and ended up putting him up for adoption. After some time, he was adopted by a coal miner who brought him to the mines for work. Gau and Bona bonded and quickly became very close. They would often have friendly pulling competitions with each other as make-believe sled dogs. Strong as he was, Gau almost always won, but he couldn't help but let Bona win every once and a while. His time with Bona made long and grueling days feel short and fun. Their friendship quickly became a precious thing.<br>&emsp;&emsp;On one fateful day, an underground explosion caused the walls to collapse on many of the mine's workers and dogs, one of them being Bona. Gau rushed to his friend's aid, but when he had finally found him, it was too late. All of the victims of the incident had succumbed to the collapsed rubble. The mines were shut down permanently, and the dogs that remained there were relocated to new homes all across Canada. Gau was inconsolable and incredibly temperamental after the incident and was immediately put into a pound as a result of his behavior.<br>&emsp;&emsp;He became reclusive, making it nearly impossible for potential adopters to see his personality or his true potential. After some time, all of the other dogs in the pound were adopted off, Gau being the only one left. His time was running out, as the shelter was going to be closed down too. Just when Gau thought it was the end for him, he was adopted by a musher from Alaska. He was brought to his new home, where he was given a nice place to sleep and warm food. Gau continued to be closed off, but the musher was patient with him and allowed him to open up at his own pace. Gau eventually learned about the sled team and grew an interest in it. The more he learned, the more he was reunited with the joy of when he and Bona would pretend to be sled dogs together in the mines. Wanting to find that feeling again, he joined the team officially.

&#x1F43E The musher gave him a small plot of land to farm vegetables and fruit, but sometimes the other dogs vandalize his crops (he doesn't seem to mind though).<br>&#x1F43E He loves growing oats and making oatmeal for the other dogs!<br>
&emsp;&emsp;"Gau was one of the original lead dogs on my long-distance team, but I moved his position to team/wheel after a few races. This was a completely mutual decision, though! There's nothing wrong with his ability to lead; in fact, he's one of the best lead dogs! But without getting into too much detail, Gau still has a lot on his mind, and I think he doesn't want to jeopardize the team potentially. I gave him a small plot of land in the corner of the sanctuary to relive his farm days and so that he can have some peace to himself. When he's not training, he's always planting new crops and bringing us vegetables for our various meals. However, there was a period when he stopped participating in training to just farm all day for weeks. I was worried about him during that time as he closed himself off again, but he returned to training not long after, raring to go! Even if he never wanted to race again, I would completely understand. But I think deep down; Gau missed being around the other dogs. Some of the other dogs can be pretty rough and wild, but he always seems to get them under control."
