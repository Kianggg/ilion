Kima
NAME: Kima<br>BREED: Siberian husky<br>FROM: Alaska, USA<br>POSITION: Lead and Team<br>TEAM: All three (Sprint/Mid/Long)<br>ARTIST: Sabrina<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Kima was born to a Siberian husky litter that belonged to a famous Alaskan photographer. She was the lucky one of the bunch, sometimes getting to accompany the photographer on his many trips around Alaska. When she grew older, the photographer taught her how to use a camera, giving her an old hand-me-down as a gift. It would be an excellent hobby for Kima, he thought. Something to keep her entertained while he was away on work trips overseas.<br>&emsp;&emsp;During this time, she became obsessed with photography, becoming fixated and taking photos of anything and everything remotely interesting. When the photographer would return from his trips, he would review her photos, noticing that most of her photos were smudged or blurred. Despite the dozens of wasted films, he encouraged her and even allowed her to become his apprentice. Kima did her best to hone her photography skills, as she wanted to impress the photographer and take the very best pictures of the beautiful world around her. During one trip, the photographer was hired to take photos for an upcoming sled dog competition being held in Iceland. It was a relatively small sprint competition, and the length of it was only 20km. Here the photographer met the Ilion musher, who had brought only four dogs with them.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Kima mingled with the dogs and took candid photos of them, showing them off and laughing together at the silliness. During the race, Kima continued to take pictures of the dogs. When reviewing the photos, she felt proud of how amazing they came out and felt invigorated and inspired. Seeing the dogs race and have fun with each other made her wish she could experience the world with them. When they arrived home, Kima told the photographer that she wanted to join the Ilion team, and as always, the photographer encouraged her. He knew they’d keep in touch, after all. The photographer called the Ilion musher, and together they made arrangements for her arrival. And just like that, Kima fit right in. A perfect match. Every once and a while, she sends photos to the photographer as mementos of her many races around the world.

&#x1F43E She takes many of the photos for the sanctuary website (Thank you, Kima!)<br>&#x1F43E She's incredibly friendly and loves making small talk with the other dogs, but overall she prefers being by herself
&emsp;&emsp;"Kima is one of my lead dogs on my long-distance team. She took over for Gau a while ago, and she's been giving it her all ever since. While she's technically "inexperienced," I wasn't hesitant in making her my new lead dog. Just from training, she has shown all the natural qualities of a leader! She's also got a down-to-earth personality and knows when to get serious, which seems to have a positive effect on the other dogs. Usually, the other dogs can kick up a fuss about me choosing lead dogs, but they follow her without a problem! And she gets along great with my other long-distance lead, Tuija. I wrote to her original owner and told him all about her promotion and how great she's performing, and as a gift, he gave her a brand new camera. That camera takes the clearest photos I've ever seen, and it's her pride and joy. I know I just praised the other dogs for behaving well with her, but sometimes the other dogs tamper with her cameras, and then that's when all hell breaks loose!"
