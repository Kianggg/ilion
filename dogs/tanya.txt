Tanya

&emsp;&emsp;As a young pup, Tanya was adopted from a disreputable breeder by a young newly-wed couple. A few red flags surrounded the breeder, but the couple completely disregarded any of the warnings, too desperate to own a Samoyed puppy. They believed that he was a perfect match for their budding family, and for a good time, he was. But when the day came that the couple had a baby of their own, they realized that they now had their plate full with things like working and raising a child, and that left no room for dealing with a rambunctious puppy. Tanya also had minor health issues resulting from his breeder’s neglect. His new owners ultimately decided that they didn’t have the extra cash or time needed to address these issues adequately. The pair took Tanya to a local sanctuary, dropping him off at the doorstep without a proper goodbye.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Fortunately for Tanya, he was dropped off at the Ilion sanctuary. But being severed from the people he loved had already taken its toll and traumatized him. His usual upbeat and energetic personality quickly hid away, and he became practically mute due to what had happened. The musher of Ilion spent extra time with him to properly address his health issues and bond with him in hopes that he would open up. Tanya steadily grew closer with them and soon enough became determined to be the best dog he could be for the musher.<br>&emsp;&emsp;By the time he reached full maturity, he had become one of the tallest and strongest dogs in the sanctuary. Because of his huge size, he can be a bit too rough with the musher and the other dogs without realizing it. But the musher knows that it’s just Tanya’s way of showing his love and appreciation for others and accepts his pummeling tendencies. The other dogs… Not so much.

&emsp;&emsp;"Tanya is one of the few dogs that I got to raise from a puppy here at the sanctuary. When he was dropped off at the sanctuary, he was very sickly. At times I was worried that he wouldn't make it, but I kept tending to him every chance I got and didn't give up. Thankfully, Tanya's health improved significantly, and he grew strong- actually, much stronger than I had anticipated (He tripled in size!). He reminds me a lot of Ajax the Great or Heracles with how strong he is now, and I'm proud that whatever I did helped him grow up to be the way he is! Due to his strength, I was originally going to make him a wheel dog, but his performance and listening skills are impeccable. It's really unlike any other, and so I ended up making him one of my lead dogs for my sprint/mid-distance team. I think part of why he's so great at following commands is because of our bond. But for some reason, he's kind of distant with the other dogs unless it's time for racing. However, whenever I'm gone, he tends to hold another dog hostage (as they've described it) because he hates being alone—often following them around or even straight-up carrying them wherever he decides to go. If I scold him for doing so, it's like the end of the world for him. My scolding is hardly so; I just kindly remind him to be nicer to the other dogs when I'm away. If I could stay by Tanya's side all the time, I would! But It's kind of impossible to take a 300+ pound Samoyed everywhere I go... Or is it?"
