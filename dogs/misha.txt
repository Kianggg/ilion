&emsp;&emsp;Misha was born to a Siberian Husky dog breeding family in Russia. Rebellious and a troublemaker from a young age, she ran away in her early years to pursue a life in the wilderness, which caused her ability to speak to lag behind. However, she enjoyed the freedom of running around at her will, hunting whatever food she needed, and overall enjoying the sights of the vast Russian forests and mountains. But despite her freedom, Misha often got lonely—she lacked the social interaction she wanted and wished for a friend. Eventually, Ilion's musher found her running outside of a small town by chance. They noticed Misha's energy and speed and thought she'd make a perfect new addition to their team. However, Misha didn't quite understand the concept of mushing, and it was difficult for the musher to explain it to her because of how energetic she was. Once Misha calmed down, she finally understood and excitingly accepted. Misha no longer spent her days alone in the Russian wilderness now that she had an abundant amount of friends. Now at Ilion, she has gotten much better at speaking and has come to enjoy racing and spending time with musher.

&#x1F43E Misha is easily amused and enjoys doing a little bit of everyone's hobbies, as long as they don't mind her company.<br>&#x1F43E She enjoys running around, bird watching, relaxing in the hot springs, and is often daydreaming <br>&#x1F43E She loves small forest critters, especially rabbits <br>&#x1F43E She puts a lot of value on her first picture with the musher, so she keeps it in her jacket pocket at all times.<br>&#x1F43E While she is a picky eater, she mostly enjoys hot seafood and hearty meals<br>&#x1F43E She gets injured easily because of overexertion, but has a high pain tolerance, so she usually puts a band-aid on it and shrugs it off.
&emsp;&emsp;"It's a given that puppies want to play instead of train, and Misha was no exception. I don't train or play with puppies very often, so looking after her was fun, and it reminded me of my early days as a musher. But I underestimated just how energetic she was. The older and more experienced dogs quickly became so frustrated with her that I soon had no choice but to pull her out of practice. All Misha wanted to do was play and make friends, and I felt guilty for jumping the gun and being too eager to have her on my team, so I took a break from training to spend time with her. During our time together, we decided to explore the sanctuary and its outskirts. We found a bunch of hidden treasures; toys and bones alike—and even a wolverine den in the forest. I even let her help me around the office a couple of times, but that was short-lived, as Jacky wasn't thrilled about having her around. Fortunately, Misha grew on her. As time passed, she eventually mellowed out enough to start training for races again. Honestly, I enjoyed the break and didn't want it to end so soon, but seeing Misha motivated got me off my feet and back onto the sled!"
