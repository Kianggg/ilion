&emsp;&emsp;Timothy was a unique corgi born in the windy land of Holyhead, Wales, under the care of a refined noble family, the Bestwicks. Corgis are much beloved loyal pets, and keeping them is a long-standing tradition of the British Crown. They are often gifted to powerful nobility as a sign of good faith. One of the most beloved royal corgis was once gifted to a duke in northern Wales. There on a stormy night, this beloved and pregnant corgi gave birth to a single little puppy different from her kind. It was Timothy - a mixed breed of a corgi and Husky. Since he was little, Timothy showed excellent resistance to the cold and had a robust and resilient personality despite his adorable looks. He would sneak outside the Manor to wander in the snowy fields during the winter, bringing back the most exquisite treasures like stones, sticks, and even tiny little conches swept up by the marine gusts of Holyhead.<br>&emsp;&emsp;One day young Lord Bestwick had to travel to the cold lands of Alaska to meet old family friends. When Timothy realized his beloved owner was going on a trip, he couldn't resist sneaking into his luggage and traveling along to snowy Alaska. He did not go hungry or ill after such a long and troubling voyage, to everyone's surprise. Instead, he was rather excited and ready to experience the wintery land that spoke so closely to him.<br>&emsp;&emsp;During one of the long walks he would take with the young lord, nightfall came, and the two ended up losing their way in the dark, icy forests. The situation quickly became dire as the young lord struggled to keep moving forward in the biting cold of the Alaskan night. Saving his master was Timothy's only priority, and instinctively he knew what to do. As quickly as he could, he darted through the dark of the night in search of aid, never giving up on his short legs. He eventually reached the Ilion sanctuary, surprising the musher and all the dogs with his unexpected arrival. The musher quickly understood that Timothy was in a pinch and followed him to help Young master Bestwick. Together with the musher, he saved the young lord and spent the night in the sanctuary.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Young lord Bestwick fell in love with Ilion that night and was delighted to listen to the musher's remarks on Timothy's outstanding speed and endurance. He realized that his beloved Tim was happier than ever in the company of all the other dogs; Timothy had found his true calling. The young master entrusted Timothy to the musher, knowing that he would live his life to the fullest there and be able to release his never-ending energy in the fields of Illion. Before departing, he gifted his beloved Timothy with regalia from his family-- the Bestwick medallion, along with the promise to visit him every year during the wintertime.

&#x1F43E  Loves to take a good nap after being fed lunch and lay belly up in the sunlight<br>&#x1F43E Enjoys treasure hunting in his downtime, and sometimes drags other dogs along. He brings back all sorts of curiosities from flowers to stones, and he always makes sure to bring something back for the musher as proof of his love and friendship!
&emsp;&emsp;"Corgis are the farthest breed of dog you would think of as a sled dog because of how short their legs are. But with Timothy, watching him run was an exciting eye-opener as he's able to use his energy to run fast through thick trails of snow. The husky mix inside of him gives him the benefit and extra boost that he needs to run. But that doesn't mean he doesn't train rigorously every day with the rest of my dogs. To upkeep his speed and endurance, I put him on the special training regime that I created for my shorter and smaller dogs in which they all practice together every day. Other mushers are shocked to know that I have a corgi mix on my team, but I always tell them that Timothy is different! Sometimes our team is mocked because of this, but Tim doesn't hesitate to put them in their place, and I'm always proud of him when he does so. But with that said, please do not train a corgi to become a sled dog; they are not built for it, and it would be endangering their health and wellbeing if you do so! As I said, Timothy is different and has the heart of a sled dog within him (quite literally!)."
