NAME: Nu<br>BREED: Alaskan Malamute<br>FROM: Northern outskirts of Mongolia <br>POSITION: Team<br>TEAM: Mid-distance and Long-distance<br>ARTIST: Designed by <a href="https://x.com/remyvtube">Remy</a>, Portrait by <a href="https://x.com/alphasasuke">Reetz</a><br>
&emsp;&emsp; Scouted by the Musher during a trip to Mongolia, Nu’s talents were immediately recognized. Living on the outskirts of the country, it was clear that the young pup had the makings of an excellent racer– possessing a competitive spirit and unbridled physical ability. As his life on the Ilion Sanctuary began, however, Nu couldn’t bring himself to feel true passion for the sport. This would come to change upon meeting one of Ilion’s top rival teams, and particularly one of their dogs, Electra. Belonging to a formidable Finnish sled dog team, the talents of the dogs were well honed.<br>&emsp;&emsp;He developed feelings for Electra, and motivated himself to get their attention by beating them in events. Despite this, however, the gap in skill was far too great– he nor the team as a whole have ever won against Electra or their musher, Luja. As the losses mounted, Nu gave up on these attempts and entered a rebellious stage where he began to skip practice, where it seemed as though his interest wasn’t so much with racing but more so in socializing with the other dogs in the Sanctuary. Despite this, however, deep down he has grown to care much more about the sport and Ilion’s Musher throughout the losses. Although training is hit or miss, he always attends racing events– perhaps to catch a glimpse of his “rival” there as well.

&#x1F43E He has the self-proclaimed personality of a playboy; but many of the other dogs just find him to be boisterous and loud<br>&#x1F43E He loves bread, especially curry bread <br>&#x1F43E He loves All-You-Can-Eat hot pot! But it's rare for the sanctuary to host these types of dinners  
&emsp;&emsp;"Nu has been one of the more enigmatic additions to the team as of recent– Or so you would think! I’ve definitely gotten used to him over time. In fact, I feel like I’ve come to understand him very well. To explain, he hates and loves the sport at the same time. He was very disinterested in racing at first, but I would often see him trying to participate in our practices even after so much protesting. I know the others have said it’s because he thinks he’s better than everyone else, but I personally believe that he’s just very shy and doesn’t want others to know how much he loves it! He’s just a little prideful is all. That’s the conclusion I’ve come up with! It makes more sense, right? It’s become a running joke, so I can’t help but tease him about it now– especially because of his little crush on Electra. It’s true that we’ve never won against musher Luja’s team. She’s a notoriously difficult musher to go up against. But Electra keeps him motivated at practicing and so I’m grateful for that one-sided rivalry. Maybe if he works hard enough, one day she’ll notice him! What? That sounds harsh? I didn’t mean it that way… She doesn’t notice any of us! A-Anyways, Nu! Don’t be shy, and please continue to work hard! We’re counting on you!"
