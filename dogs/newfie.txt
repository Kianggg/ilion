Newfie
NAME: Newfie<br>BREED: St. Bernard<br>FROM: Newfoundland, Canada<br>POSITION: Lead<br>TEAM: Sprint<br>ARTIST: M<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Newfie was a rescue dog that spent most of his life in the deep snowy mountains of Newfoundland, Canada. He was always there to guide people to safety, whether it be lost skiers, snowboarders, hikers, or even unlucky locals.<br>&emsp;&emsp;One day, during the Chickpea Challenge mushing competition (mid-distance; 200 miles), a heavy snowstorm had hit the course, and one of the teams was thrown off the trail and stranded. Newfie was tasked with finding them and bringing them back onto the trail. He successfully found them and put them back on their course—and somehow, without realizing it, he ended up accompanying them to the finish line. Despite the significant detour, the team had won first place, and it was all thanks to Newfie's help. Getting to experience the victory with them inspired him, and from that day forward, Newfie knew he wanted to become a sled dog.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Leaving his job on good terms, he sought out the Ilion sanctuary and asked to join the team. Recognizing him, the musher of Ilion was overjoyed and quickly welcomed him in, and after some time, got him established as part of their team.

&#x1F43E Newfie is first aid certified, and his equipment is carried on the sled during races.<br>&#x1F43E He likes wood-working and loves to carve toys for the other dogs <br>&#x1F43E During his downtime he loves drinking brandy, even if it's not allowed on sanctuary grounds. He may or may not secretly brew the brandy himself.
&emsp;&emsp;"Even before Newfie had asked if he could join the team, I saw the potential for a lead dog in him. Without him, we would’ve never made first place, let alone finish the race! But it wasn’t about winning at all; it was about the confidence he gave the other dogs when guiding us and the way he accompanied the lead dog like a natural. The funny thing is, Newfie comes across as a different dog at the sanctuary. He appears lazy sometimes, which can cause commotions between him and the other dogs, especially during training. Somehow he's always getting his paws on alcohol, and every time I take it away, he's got a new bottle. No idea where he keeps getting it from, but one day I'll figure it out. But regardless of that, he's always dependable no matter what. I don’t regret entrusting him as my lead because I know that I can always count on him!"
