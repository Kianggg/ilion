Bonnie
NAME: Bonnie<br>BREED: Black Russian Terrier<br>FROM: Russia<br>POSITION: Lead<br>TEAM: Mid-distance<br>ARTIST: Tareo<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Growing up, Bonnie idolized her big sister who was a police dog, and consequently decided to follow in her footsteps as soon as she grew old enough. She trained and trained, and was screened for acceptance into the force on several occasions, but failed to make the cut time and time again. Bonnie eventually grew fed up and threw in the towel. After what seemed like ages of hard work and seemingly endless ambition, Bonnie lost sight of her true potential and became aimless.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Seeing Bonnie so deflated was greatly upsetting to her owner. They knew Bonnie needed to find something new to put her focus on, she needed to be reminded that she was so much more than what her prior setbacks seemed to suggest—no, she was adventurous, athletic, and incredibly observant above all. Following the advice of their peers, Bonnie’s owner brought her up to the snowy mountains for a hike together. While there, the two came across a small throng of dogs, as well as their owner—The Ilion sled dog team and their musher respectively. Bonnie was interested in the dogs and approached them by herself.<br>&emsp;&emsp;She introduced herself and got along well with them, and in no time they ended up playing together. While they played, Bonnie’s owner got to talking with the group’s musher. Bonnie’s owner explained to the musher what Bonnie had gone through with police training, and how sad she’d been as a result of it ever since. The two owners then regarded Bonnie in the moment; she was finally happy again, keeping up with the other sled dogs like it was no problem as they played and ran around together.<br>&emsp;&emsp;“Will you let us keep Bonnie?” The musher proposed, “she’s so energetic, and she gets along with the others so well. I think she’d make a great addition to our team.” It was hard for Bonnie’s owner to let her go, but in the end it made all the difference. They wanted her to be happy. She now thrives in her life as a sled dog, more lively than ever before.

&emsp;&emsp;"Every musher is different when it comes to their lead dogs. Personally for me there are a lot of factors for choosing my leads, but there's also a certain something that I look for—That certain something is a secret though, and I've never told anyone what it is. No amount of begging from my dogs, friends, or colleagues will make me spill! But I can say with confidence that Bonnie had that certain something, and I noticed it the day that we met. It was a hasty decision on my part, but I made her lead for her very first race with us. I could tell that she was nervous and that the pressure made her feel like she was trying out to be a police dog again. But I assured her that she wasn't going to fail, that I trusted her and that I knew she was going to do great. In hindsight, I realize how selfish I was acting; something I don't often do with my dogs. Thankfully she trusted me, and with that trust we won the race that day! When I snapped out of my craze, the realization that I might've pushed her too hard set in, but she was grateful that I did. But if anyone was grateful, it was me! To have such a forgiving and understanding dog... And sorry to act selfish again, but I'm happy that Bonnie joined us. It's not even about finding a new lead or winning a race. I'm just happy that I met her, and the police academy is crazy for never choosing her. They're missing out on an incredible and hardworking dog! A-Anyways, I'm sorry for sounding a little crazy in this comment. Bonnie, you're an amazing dog! Thank you for always trusting in me!"
