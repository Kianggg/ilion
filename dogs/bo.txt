&emsp;&emsp;Bo is the son of a popular team dog from a mushing team in Wyoming. He idolized his mother as a pup and spent his younger days training hard in hopes to one day be as good as she was. She would always praise him for his effort, passively encouraging him to keep up the hard work. However, when he finally grew old enough to join the team, their dynamic took a turn for the worst.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Bo's mother began to see her son as a threat to her fame and position, wary of any praise that he received from the musher. Jealous and bitter, she allowed her pride to take over, not wanting him to replace her spot on the team. When it came time for the team's new positions to be chosen, Bo's mother lied and told him that the musher changed their mind and said his performance didn't make the cut. Bo was devastated and felt that he had trained hard all those years for nothing. Not feeling an ounce of remorse, his mother led Bo down an unfamiliar trail where she said that his new owners would later arrive to pick him up. After saying their bittersweet goodbyes, Bo stood somberly and patiently waited for his new owners to come.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It wasn't until nightfall that he realized that he had been abandoned-that his mother had lied to him. He came to wonder if being rejected from the team was a lie too. He took off to find out the truth but got lost and ended up miles away from his home. He ended up at a ranch in the middle of nowhere, and the family who owned it took him in. Bo accepted his fate and decided to stay, becoming a ranch dog for his new family. Regardless of everything that happened, Bo still wanted to be a sled dog and continued to train during his downtime. Months later, Bo's original owner found him at the ranch. They apologized for what had happened and reinvited him to the team. But his hatred for his mother burned strong, and he coldly rejected their offer. Seeing his old musher reignited his determination to become better than his mother, and so he soon left the ranch without saying goodbye in pursuit of a team that would take him in.<br>&emsp;&emsp;After many months of traversing the cold mountains and landscapes of North America, he finally came across the Ilion sanctuary, where he was taken in. At first, Bo was motivated by his hatred for his mother but still felt insecure about his skills, which greatly hindered his performance. But being accepted by everyone at the sanctuary made him realize that he should race for himself instead of revenge.

&emsp;&emsp;"Bo traveled a long way from Wyoming to Alaska, and because of this, I was eager to place him on my long-distance team. I knew his resilience and endurance would make him a great addition to the team! However, when we trained, I could tell something was bothering him. He's rather shy, so he said everything was fine, but during his first race with us, he was very distracted-at the third checkpoint, he had to be switched out due to fatigue. After that race, he opened up to me about his mother, and everything began to make more sense. He was full of self-doubt and second-guessed himself all the time, and the pressure of being on the long-distance team got to him. I should've realized that traveling from point A to point B on your own time isn't the same as racing in a long-distance race. As a musher, I have to be patient and attentive with my dogs, and so I switched him over to my sprint/mid-distance team and told him I would do my best for him. He was understandably still reluctant to open up, but he eventually came around and began to feel more comfortable. After a few weeks, he raced in his first sprint race with us, and we took home first place. He was really proud of himself, and ever since then, he's been continuously getting better in both strength and mind!"
