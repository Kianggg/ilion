Millius
NAME: Millius<br>BREED: Siberian Husky<br>FROM: Talkeetna, Alaska<br>POSITION: Ilion's cheerleader & race queen<br>TEAM: N/A<br>ARTIST: <a href="https://x.com/lapithai">Roby</a><br>
&emsp;&emsp;The team and I met Millius in Talkeetna. She was an adventurous and friendly husky that roamed around the small town and naturally befriended everyone around her! She took an interest in my team and wanted to follow us back home. At first, I felt bad that we would be taking such an important resident of Talkeetna away, but she insisted on joining us. Even the townspeople encouraged it, as long as she’d come back to visit every once in a while~! Now, Millius is Ilion’s official cheerleader! <br>&emsp;&emsp;Apparently, she’s also a race queen, and at first I had no idea what that was until Paris explained the concept to me. Something about Formula one, grid girls, Japanese motor sports, and pit crews…? I’m sorry, I’m not too sure– it's not my field of expertise. There was a lot of information given to me at the time and I didn’t realize how passionate Paris was about Auto racing– I don’t pay too much attention to racing outside of sled dogs, but I’ll try my best to stay focused next time! <br>&emsp;&emsp;Anyways, Millius is just like a real sports cheerleader! Always boosting the morale of the team when things get tough. She’s always seeing us off at the starting line, and is there waiting to give us a warm greeting at the finish line! We owe a big thanks to Millius for always supporting us and helping to keep our spirits up! Thank you, Millius!<br>&emsp;&emsp;One last thing! Millius found a mole in one of the racing locations we visited. It wasn’t in Alaska– but I can’t seem to remember where. The two have become such good friends that the mole is now also a cheerleader too and a new honorary resident of Ilion!
