Orca
NAME: Orca<br>BREED: Siberian Husky + German Shepherd mix<br>FROM: Healy, Alaska<br>POSITION: Swing<br>TEAM: Sprint<br>ARTIST: Ray<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Orca was raised by a musher from Healy, Alaska, who just so happened to be a rival to Ilion's own. He was born slightly underweight in stature, and because of this he always felt the need to prove that he was more than meets the eye to those around him. Growing up, he would almost always go about every training activity with an overzealous attitude. This would constantly put him at odds with the other dogs, as they found it obnoxious. Being part of a sled team means getting along with your teammates, but Orca would constantly form rivalries with every dog that breathed the same air as him.<br>&emsp;&emsp;After a violent fight broke out between Orca and another dog, the musher decided that they couldn't tolerate his aggression anymore, and put him up for adoption. Orca was devastated; his racing career was already over before it even began, having never gotten the chance to make his debut in a race yet. Luckily for Orca, his old musher had a big mouth, having told fellow mushers about how they had to put a scrawny and mean dog up for adoption because he kept causing trouble with the others. The musher of Ilion was one of those who had overheard this and became concerned, immediately going to the shelter to meet and later adopt Orca.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Orca was confused at first, believing that the musher was misguided or pulling a prank, which made it hard for him to trust them. But the Ilion musher had what Orca's previous musher didn't, and that was patience. Beneath his bitterness, Orca was afraid of being abandoned again. But for quite some time, he couldn't help his old behaviors and would still butt heads with the other dogs, or snap at anyone who looked at him the wrong way. However, no matter how many times he acted out, the Ilion musher never gave up on him. They continued to encourage him and never once punished him for any of his bad behaviors.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Orca realized in time that the second chance he was given by the Ilion musher was genuine, and he began to feel indebted and grateful. Not wanting to further disappoint the musher, he made it his goal to get his act together. From then on, Orca began to work harder than ever before in order to make the musher proud, and to finally be recognized as a great sled dog by everyone. He still sometimes gets into trouble with the other dogs, but above all, he has come to love being part of a team and has learned to control his temper better. In fact, he even got permission from the musher to attend a school for obedience training, to which he passed with flying colors!

&emsp;&emsp;"When I first brought Orca to Ilion, he was convinced that it was all a setup and that I was going to abandon him just like his previous musher. He started to vandalize the sanctuary, destroy my belongings, and even began fighting the other dogs during training to provoke me to abandon him. All of this, and I never once bit. I understood why he was acting this way, and so I continued to be patient with him-reassuring him that the Ilion sanctuary is his home! Orca was a bit disgruntled for a while, but he started to trust me, and his performance when racing began to improve a lot. Orca admitted to me that he wanted to become a lead dog, but unfortunately, his performance wasn't suited for the position. He was upset about it but didn't let my evaluation stop him. He asked if he could go to obedience school, to which I granted permission. After a few months, he passed the class and earned a degree in perfect obedience. I was so proud of him that I had it framed and hung it up in the front office. Unfortunately, due to a few factors, Orca is still not a lead dog. But regardless, he's come so far since his arrival, and I know if he keeps it up, he'll be a great lead dog one day. Sometimes I'll tell visitors who happen to be passing by the front office that the degree on the wall belongs to one of my future lead dogs!"
