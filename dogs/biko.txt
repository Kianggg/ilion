&emsp;&emsp;Biko is an energetic, friendly, and loyal pup born and raised in Norrbotten, Sweden, by a devoted woodworker. He owned a small workshop just outside of town, and Biko would spend her days as a companion to him, helping him by carrying lumber from lumber yards to his workshop. When she wasn't working, she spent most of her time observing and admiring the fine craftsmanship that her owner brought to life. Through that, she grew a deep-rooted appreciation for woodwork. Her life was peaceful, and she enjoyed living with the old man. But it was undeniable that she was too energetic for him. While on walks, she would pull too hard and cause him to stumble. While making her way through his workshop, she'd accidentally knock things over. Sometimes she would even chew on his artwork, aware that it would get her in trouble, yet unable to resist her canine urges. The woodworker would get upset with her, but he found it tough to stay mad at her for long. More often than not, he'd forgive her almost instantly. He could always carve another sculpture after all.<br>&emsp;&emsp;But because of his old age and the sheer amount of energy Biko had, it ultimately became too difficult for him to handle her. His heart broke at the thought of parting with her, but he felt it was best to find her an owner that could properly match her level of energy-someone to give her the proper space and time to run and play. Before he could take Biko to a shelter, the Ilion musher had visited the shop in hopes of bringing a souvenir back home. When the woodworker learned of their profession, he offered Biko to them, asking if they could take care of her and let her be part of their team.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Although the musher was always happy to take a new dog under their wing, they could tell that parting with Biko was too hard for the old man; but they came to understand the circumstances. And so the musher accepted Biko into the Ilion sanctuary and sled team, promising the man that his dog was in good hands. Biko was devastated at first. She didn't want to leave her home, nearly believing that she did something terrible and was being sent away because of it. But after a bit of reassurance and careful explanation, she understood. And so, out of the love she had for her old owner, she accepted her new home in Alaska. Before leaving, she promised the woodworker that she would send him lumber from all over the world so that they can stay connected.

&#x1F43E She loves collecting sticks and twigs, burying them, chewing them, and sometimes carving them to create art<br>&#x1F43E Self taught herself the "how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood" tongue twister without fail<br>
&emsp;&emsp;"I'll be honest and say that at first, I felt guilty for bringing Biko to the Ilion sanctuary, even though I was asked to. She was down for a while when she arrived, and I did everything I could to make her feel at home. Thankfully the other dogs were quick to befriend her, and it wasn't long before she was her cheerful self that I first saw when I visited Sweden. Sometimes i's hard to contain her energy, but I'm glad she's feeling comfortable now. She's excellent when it comes to training, sometimes clumsy but always moving forward no matter what. Unfortunately, she tends to get distracted on the trail and will collect sticks for me to send back to Sweden. Sometimes the sticks are whole branches from trees, which are impossible to ship. I didn't want to upset her, so I came up with the idea of taking the branches and carving them into small pieces of art just like her owner. She was already very talented at it, and some carvings she makes we display around the clinic (It has also made shipping a lot more reasonable)."
