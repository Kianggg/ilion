&emsp;&emsp;Emil is the child of two retired sled dogs, bred to become part of a famous sled team. Emil was very well trained as a puppy but lacked experience in pulling, so he always looked to other sled dogs for guidance. Unfortunately, his owner wasn't able to continue with the team due to health issues. Emil and the other puppies were then put up for adoption before they could debut in their first race. A hospital in Diogenes adopted Emil, and used him as a therapy/companion dog; where he provided company to patients and gave them lots of soft, fluffy comfort. He loved his new job and all the naps and snuggles that came with it, but had a bittersweet feeling inside that made him long to become the sled dog he was born to be.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Sometime later, Emil was retired as a companion dog and relocated to a nearby sanctuary in order to be rehomed. Emil learned that the sanctuary was home to the Ilion sled team, having heard of them in passing while living with his original owner. Supposedly, his original owner and the Ilion musher were friendly rivals. Emil was a bit shy at first, but he felt eager to pull again and decided to jump into participating in the training sessions. The other dogs and the Ilion musher were impressed by his pulling power, and he was quickly invited to join the team. Emil happily accepted, and his temporary status at the Ilion sanctuary became permanent. At last, he was finally able to live out his dreams. He often misses the days of taking naps in the sun, but he's come to realize that taking a nap after a day of training and racing feels way more fulfilling.

&emsp;&emsp;"Emil is very soft and fluffy, so much that it seems like he's more cloud than dog. When you lay on his tail, you end up falling asleep right away. A couple of times after I've had a stressful day, he's offered his tail as a pillow to me-and I swear it has healing powers cause I woke up feeling energized and refreshed! As if the concept of stress never existed in the first place~ It makes me understand why he was a therapy dog for a while before coming to the sanctuary. His healing powers come in handy during training and competitions, especially during checkpoints. It helps the other dogs because when things get rough out on the trail, it can be incredibly demoralizing for them to keep going. But even though Emil is incredibly soft, don't let it fool you cause he's really powerful! He comes from a long line of sled dogs, and even though he was out of practice for a while, he adapted fast. However, he's prone to distractions, chasing after any critter he sees during the trail, which is a bad mix with his strength. There's been a few times where he dragged the whole team on a quest to find a squirrel- but thankfully, this has only happened during training!"
