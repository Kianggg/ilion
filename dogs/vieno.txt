Vieno
NAME: Vieno<br>BREED: Karjalan karhukoira (Karelian Beardog)<br>FROM: Saimaa, Finland<br>POSITION: Wheel<br>TEAM: Long-distance<br>ARTIST: <a href="https://x.com/poopeepeopo">Nao</a><br>
&emsp;&emsp;Born to a family of a well respected and highly praised line of Karelian Bear Hunting Dogs, Vieno would prove to be both highly intelligent and strong even as a young pup. However, as she grew, it became apparent that she had a very anxious and paranoid nature. She would face great difficulties in training. With an unpredictable disposition, her fearfulness would often cause her to go into fight or flight, to the point where she would even come to attack her trainers and fellow dogs. Despite her fear, her family still recognized her amazing strength and believed she would thrive in a suitable environment, rather than being left as a lapdog. Thus, she was presented the opportunity at Ilion Rescue. <br>&emsp;&emsp;Her anxious nature will always be a part of her, but being in a safe environment has helped her grow. She has become more sociable and developed trust and faith in both herself and her peers. She is still mostly self reliant and tends to keep to herself, enjoying solo activities such as fishing, trapping, and handcrafts. With the kindness and patience provided to her at the Sanctuary, she has begun to open up more and more.

&#x1F43E <br>&#x1F43E Vieno has much longer fur than the typical beardog, and as she hates brushing, her fur is often very scruffy and messy, making her look like a startled cat! <br>&#x1F43E She is very knowledgable on flora and fauna all around, having a deep curiosity for the world around her
&emsp;&emsp;"The health and safety of my dogs is my top priority and mushing is an unpredictable sport– Moose, bears, blizzards, injuries, and more. Even though what I’m saying sounds scary, it’s just the reality of what racing can be like. No musher wants their team to run into any sort of danger, but it’s important to be prepared for anything. With that being said, I didn’t rush Vieno onto the team when she was introduced to me. I never do that for any dog unless they explicitly want to join the team. Actually, I wanted to avoid including her on the team because of the reasons I stated before. Racing is not hunting obviously, but the dangers still exist regardless. But I think she knew that, and wanted to use racing as a way to overcome her anxieties and fears. Since that day, she’s been working very hard to do just that! I’ve specifically placed her as a wheel dog on one of my long-distance teams because of her surprising strength, and so that she could be closer to me. With the way she’s been performing, I’ve been reconsidering her position in the team lineup! But I think she feels comfortable near the sled, so for now I’ll leave her be~ I’m relieved and proud to know how much progress she’s made since the day we met!"
