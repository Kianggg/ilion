&emsp;&emsp;Farm-born and raised; Work hard and play hard is Mabel's way of life! Initially working at a family farm in northern Denmark, she naturally took to herding and pulling stock with her boundless energy. However, a couple of years into work, the family fell into financial hardship and were forced to close down the farm. And with that, they made the tough decision to send Mabel into a shelter and foster program. No longer with a way to release energy, Mabel found herself being bounced around several foster homes. She was a friendly dog, but her boisterous behavior and constant need for movement were too much to handle for families looking for a simple pet. The shelter noticed this and decided that she would be a good fit as a potential sled dog at one of their partnering sanctuaries in Greenland. The sanctuary specialized in taking energetic dogs and giving them a new purpose as sled dogs so that professional mushers across the world could adopt them.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Mabel was apprehensive about the move at first. The thought of being tied to a harness was daunting as she heavily preferred roaming around freely. But despite the unease of her new placement, a part of her was excited to finally be given a purposeful task, something she missed a lot. With that, she was moved over to the large island and began her training. Much to her surprise (and dismay), it wasn't very green!<br>&emsp;&emsp;Months passed by, and the Greenland sanctuary held a small adoption event for their dogs. The Ilion musher was invited to attend and was introduced to several dogs, one being Mabel, who stood out above the rest. The musher noted that Mabel's fiddling of the harness and restlessness was of concern but that she had great potential regardless. Taking a liking to her sweet demeanor, they decided to take a chance on her and bring her back to Alaska. But Mabel's short time training at the Greenland sanctuary proved to be lackluster. She had several mishaps when training with the Ilion team, which made her incredibly upset as she didn't enjoy underperforming. But the musher didn't give up on her and still believed in her potential. With careful and skillful guidance and help from other fellow sled dogs, Mabel gradually came to find her place within the Ilion team, being beloved by everyone and enjoying her new life as a fully-fledged sled dog.

&#x1F43E Drools heavily. Sometimes it freezes on her face if it's cold enough.<br>&#x1F43E Super loud, and possibly the loudest dog. It's like you adjusted her volume to max, even if she's not yelling.<br>&#x1F43E Will sometimes be naughty or not follow directions, but it's never malicious- she's just scatterbrained.
&emsp;&emsp;"I've only been to Greenland twice before, so being invited back for a sled dog adoption event was exciting! I wish I could've brought all of the dogs home, but Mabel was the one that caught my eye! I knew immediately that she would be a perfect addition to the team, but I was only allowed to adopt one dog. So I resisted choosing her for a second to give the other dogs a chance, but I ended up picking her in the end. And honestly, I wouldn't pick any differently! Mabel made herself at home almost right away, and she's always a bundle of joy to be around. But that bundle of joy can be hard to contain, and it was hard to get her to pay attention during training. But once she understood the appeal of mushing, her attitude quickly changed-now she's always giving 110%! That reminds me, one time when I was questioning if being a sled dog was the right fit for her, I suggested that she could be a pet dog; she wouldn't have to wear the harness, and she could play freely around the sanctuary. She yelled no so loud that my ears were ringing for a good five hours. According to Mabel, being a pet is boring, and doing fifty cartwheels in a row is more fun than napping in the sun. Every time I remember that I can't help but laugh to myself. I've never met a dog who hates relaxing! Mabel is truly something!"
