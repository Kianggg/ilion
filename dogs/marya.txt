&emsp;&emsp;Marya was born outside of a remote village in Siberia, feral and alone for as long as she could remember. Learning to hunt and scavenge at a very early age, she kept herself sustained on small game and scraps left behind by bigger predators. When things were scarce and she grew desperate for food, she would often venture into nearby towns to search for an easy meal but usually got shooed off by the locals. Marya maintained this lifestyle for most of her life, too busy trying to fend for herself to realize just how lonely she was.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Ilion musher had been traversing by bus on a trip from Chukotka to Kamchatka when the bus’ front wheel went flat, and the trip had to come to a temporary standby for repairs. At the time, Marya was somewhere nearby searching for food when she heard the commotion. Desperate for a meal, she approached the scene carefully. When the bus driver spotted her, they panicked and were prepared to use a rash amount of force to keep her from attacking the passengers and them. But the musher promptly stopped them and reassured them to stay calm. Taking their time, the musher approached Marya with caution, but the closer they got, the more wary and hostile she became. Scary as it was, the musher knew that she was more scared of them than they were her and cautiously pressed on. When they got close enough, they realized that Marya’s paw had somehow sustained an injury. Having an emergency kit on them, they managed to lure her in with food, and with some gentle persuasion, were able to tend to her wounded paw. She was timid at first but was able to tell that the musher meant no harm to her.<br>&emsp;&emsp;By the time the musher finished patching her up, the bus’ wheel had finally been repaired. The musher had no option but to leave her behind and hastily get back on. However, when turning back to wave goodbye to Marya, they saw that she was chasing after them. The musher convinced the bus driver to stop the vehicle once more, and to the driver’s dismay, they coaxed her to come on board. Everyone on the bus felt wary of the enormous feral animal being let on the bus with them, but Marya was surprisingly well behaved. You would think she was domestic, but in truth, despite only being with the musher for a brief amount of time, Marya felt a sense of harmony with them. She knew from then on that she needed to protect them. After the musher took care of things in Kamchatka, the two of them traveled back east and across the Bering Sea to Alaska, where they took her to the Ilion sanctuary to become a permanent resident.

&emsp;&emsp;"Despite the minor delay on my trip, I'm glad the bus' tire went flat that day. As silly as it sounds, I always feel like it's fate that brings me and my dogs together. I know the other passengers on the bus thought I was insane for bringing her on board. But even though she can be pretty intimidating, she's a huge sweetheart and has a very protective nature, which can be both good and bad at times. There was a time when I would talk with visitors, and she would get in front of me and try to scare them off. This caused a lot of problems for a while, but we have since corrected this behavior. A good example is whenever another dog is upset, she's always the first to calm them down with an embrace. Her embrace can feel like the life is being squeezed out of you, but she means well! Due to her excessive strength, I decided to make her a wheel dog on my sprint/mid-distance team. At first, I was going to make her a lead dog because of how well she follows my directions, but she can be defiant at times, which I can't have in a lead. Thankfully she's happy being a wheel dog as she gets to oversee the team and be close to me!"
