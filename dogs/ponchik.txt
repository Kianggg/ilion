Ponchik
NAME: Ponchik<br>BREED: Samoyed<br>FROM: Poland<br>POSITION: Team and Wheel<br>TEAM: Mid and Long-distance<br>ARTIST: <a href="https://twitter.com/mchvoss">Michi Voss</a><br>
&emsp;&emsp;Born in a breeding facility, Ponchik was adopted as a young pup by two elderly farmers; a husband and wife. As she grew, helping the couple on their farm became a daily routine, herding sheep and ducks and handling all of the hard labor the couple couldn't do. The work was easy for her, as she thought there was no better reward than coming home to a warm meal and a pat on the head.<br>&emsp;&emsp;As years passed, she began taking care of the couple, helping them with simple tasks they were getting too frail to do. Ponchik continued to help with everything until both of her owners passed away from old age, first the husband, then the wife soon after. Depressed, Ponchik felt lonely without them and couldn't stand to be there anymore, so she left, searching for something to make the empty feeling in her heart disappear.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Luckily, it wasn't too long until she'd meet the Ilion musher, who was visiting Poland at the time. The musher took a liking to Ponchik's friendly demeanor and adopted her, taking her back to Alaska with them. They showed her around the sanctuary, and she quickly felt at home. Already in great physical health, racing piqued her interest, and it seemed like a great new start for her. At first, it was daunting-- being around so many new dogs made her nervous. However, racing made her feel excited and useful again, so she continued to work her hardest at it and grew to love the team like a new family. Even though the memory of her original owners often weighed heavy in her thoughts, she's delighted and grateful to have another start.

&emsp;&emsp;"When I met her for the first time, she was really shy and hesitant to let me pet her, but she eventually came around. I gave her treats and played with her for a while before I left. At first I thought she was a stray so I almost brought her home with me! But she had a collar, so I said my goodbyes that day so she could go back to her owners. However, she followed me back to where I was staying. That's when I learned about what happened to her original owners. I didn't want to leave her alone so I brought her back to Alaska to provide her with a new home. I was worried that she would be too shy to mingle with the other dogs, but I was happy to see her get along with everyone so well. She was introduced to racing and immediately took a liking to it. But racing isn't enough for Ponchik as she loves to work! Some days, she helps Gau on his mini-farm as it reminds her of her daily life back in Poland. Now despite her fitting in faster than I had expected, there are nights where she wanders off into the darkness to be alone with her thoughts. When I finished my work one night, some of the other dogs and I followed her to see where she was going. We saw her stargazing up on a hill not far from the kennels. We joined her and looked up at the millions of stars that decorated the night sky. She still goes out alone to stargaze, but I think she really enjoyed our company that one night so there are times when she invites us to go with her. We'll spend the whole night looking for constellations and waiting for shooting stars to go by. I'm happy to get to spend time like this with her and everyone. It's always small moments like these that make me so happy to be a musher."
