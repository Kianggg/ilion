&emsp;&emsp;Doudou was the result of a hushed rendezvous that took place between his Mama Poodle and the neighboring Samoyed. He was the runt of the litter, the youngest and the smallest of his 5 brothers and sisters. His siblings would often tease him for his small stature, but the thing that hurt poor Doudou the most was that he couldn't bark! He would get so embarrassed when his siblings would mock his whines and whimpers. <br>&emsp;&emsp;His owner wanted to help Doudou become more confident, so she took him to a mushing competition in town. As Doudou watched the other dogs pulling on the sleds, his eyes lit up. They were so strong and fast, and he wanted to be just like them! Seeing the spark in Doudou's eyes, his owner went to talk to Ilion’s Musher and see if he could join the sled team. The Musher gladly accepted him, sensing the brightness of Doudou’s newfound passion. <br>&emsp;&emsp;Since joining the Musher's care, Doudou has grown into a very weighty dog. He looks far from the runt he used to be, not to mention how much he eats! More than anything, he loves to run and can sprint at high speeds. He's finally learned how to bark, too– well, sort of, at least. The only time he'll bark is when he's hungry and there's a delicious plate of food in front of him!

&emsp;&emsp;"When Doudou’s original owner told me about how his eyes sparkled upon seeing the team race, I couldn’t help but reminisce about that same feeling– I felt it many years ago when I would volunteer as a racing veterinarian– the excitement of everyone’s shared passion to race! It was the reason why I started my own team! So to me, I felt a great responsibility to help Doudou learn the ways of being a sled dog! There were some difficulties at first though. He confided in me about how things used to be for him. Being picked on by his siblings and not being able to vocalize himself properly. It hindered him during practice for a little while, causing him to be anxious around the team. But thankfully, with the help of some of the other dogs who had gone through similar troubles, we were able to guide him and he quickly grew into a more confident dog! And in turn, his performance in racing improved significantly! That sparkle he had in his eyes was honed into something amazing! Now not only are his skills in racing on par with veteran sled dogs, but his bark is as loud as the huskies on the team! Maybe even louder! I remember the day he confidently asked Jacky for a fourth serving of food– the medium-sized dogs are usually given one hefty serving– two for the larger dogs. Jacky has complained to me about this before since she usually pre-portions everything, and I do understand the dilemma…Hm… I guess I should talk to Doudou about that since any food related disruptions cause fighting amongst the dogs… But still! Him being confident to ask for more food is a good sign! A sign of all of his hard work! I’ll definitely talk to him about this, but regardless, I’m proud of him!"
