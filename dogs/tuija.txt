NAME: Tuija<br>BREED: Alaskan Husky<br>FROM: Rovaniemi, Finland<br>POSITION: Lead<br>TEAM: Long-distance<br>ARTIST: <a href="https://twitter.com/kaijukaj">Kaj</a><br>
&emsp;&emsp;Tuija is a sled dog legend and veteran hailing from Rovaniemi, Finland: one of the mushing capitals of the world. The sound of the wind in her ears, the thrill of running, and the vast, beautiful scenery of the mountains are some reasons that make racing her passion, but above all else is that she loves to win. She was incredibly popular in Scandinavia and still holds a celebrity status to this day.<br>&emsp;&emsp;While Tuija did love the spotlight, her teammates and musher let it get to their heads, and they began to rely too much on her. They started to slack off and goof around during races and no longer put any effort into it. They began to fall behind in competition, causing Tuija to pick up the slack when she shouldn't have had to. She eventually grew fed up, and after winning an 800km race in Canada, she decided to quit. As she left the team, not once turning back to say goodbye, her former teammates were left in shock. Despite her cold exit, she still felt hugely disappointed that things had to come to that. Soon before getting ready for her departure back to Finland, she caught sight of another team that had just arrived at the finish line.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Even though the team had finished last, they showed a certain passion and excitement that reminded her of how things used to be. It got to her in some way, deep inside. She approached the team's musher and asked if she could join them, and all of the dogs were in disbelief: "The famous racing legend Tuija wants to join the Ilion racing team!" They were somewhat of a new sled team then, not even fully formed yet. Despite being a celebrity, the legendary Tuija wanted to join their team. The musher of Ilion welcomed her with open arms, and from there, she began to race with them. Her old team felt betrayed, and through her departure, the Ilion sled team had gained a rival, determined to win against Tuija. But she pays no attention to them, as she firmly believes that no one can win against her.

&emsp;&emsp;"I'm still in shock that Tuija wanted to join my team. She's one of the best lead dogs in the world, and she's got a HUGE fanbase. I remember following her races during my early mushing days, hoping to find a lead dog like her one day. I was shaken up for a while when she first joined for many reasons-But she trusted me greatly from the get-go, and so I had to put on my game face! Unfortunately, even before Tuija's arrival, we haven't won first place for any long-distance competitions. We've come close, but even with Tuija's help, we still fall short a few places. I know the other dogs want to win too, so it's not just Tuija that's feeling the disappointment. As a way to compensate for the losses, I offered to place her as my lead dog on my sprint/mid-distance team (since that team wins more first places), but she was adamant on long-distant races. Honestly, I was anxiously waiting for her to leave us, but she thankfully hasn't! She told me that she wants to make Ilion her permanent home. Even if we don't win, our passion for racing is something that she missed greatly. Also, I think she gets satisfaction knowing that we beat any "rival" team (especially her old team) even if we fall short of first. I have to say, I don't consider any other team a rival to Ilion, but I agree that it is pretty satisfying to beat those who view us as such. I don't want anyone to look down on my dogs! They're amazing, and I swear we'll get first place in a long-distance race one day! I promise!"
