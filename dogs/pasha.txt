&emsp;&emsp;Pasha was born in Kirovsk, Russia, to a litter of puppies belonging to a sled dog tour company owner. She was initially thought to be the runt of the litter but quickly grew to be the biggest. Pasha has incredible pulling strength, which her owner found helpful for their tour operations. Typically for sled dog tours, an entire team of dogs is needed to pull the guests. But since Pasha is so powerful, her owner had her pull tour sleds all on her own. It wasn’t fair, but not knowing any better and wanting to be a good dog for her owner, she went along with it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Pasha was advertised to tourists as a lone wolf, and for the sake of reinforcing this as truth, she was often kept separate from the other dogs. The reality was that Pasha was desperate for a friend and wanted to play with the other dogs. She felt tremendously lonely and would often hide away in her pen, silently crying herself to sleep. Out of the blue, her owner closed down his business, and she was put up for adoption at a local kennel. It didn’t bother her much at first because she felt excited that she could finally make friends! But because of her size, the kennel owners continued to keep her isolated in fear that she would hurt the other dogs by accident. Pasha was (and still is) naïve and didn’t quite understand the issue people had with her size. She began to believe that everyone was punishing her for some reason unknown to her.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Ilion musher passed through Murmansk one day when they decided to visit the local kennel to check on their dogs. The conditions seemed fine there, great even. But upon further inspection, they noticed a dog that was isolated, sitting sadly by herself. Concerned, they asked the workers about it, to which they replied in jest that Pasha was a bear. The musher didn’t like the condescending tone of the workers and quickly decided to adopt her, bringing her home to Alaska with them. Pasha saw the other dogs in the sanctuary and wanted to play with them but felt hesitant, as she was used to being forbidden from doing so. But with the help of the musher’s gentle persuasion, she was finally able to make friends. Before she knew it, she had found her place on Ilion’s mushing team. Now she never has to do it on her own anymore; she has a whole flock of friends by her side!

&#x1F43E The musher is unsure of what breed Pasha is and suspects she is a wolf-dog<br>&#x1F43E Pasha is the tallest dog residing at the sanctuary (6'6"). She believes
she is everyone's big sister<br>&#x1F43E  She acts like a mature big sister in front of smaller dogs to make herself look more dependable to the musher, but is actually very clueless and naïve. Her naivety and innocence makes her prone to being the victim of pranks and jokes without being aware that she's being made fun of.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;"The imposed idea of Pasha being a bear couldn't be farther from the truth. Yes, Pasha is the biggest dog in the sanctuary, but she is still a puppy at heart. And like many big dogs, she doesn't realize her size or strength, but she's the sweetest dog you'll ever meet. Many other mushers are surprised that I didn't make Pasha a wheel dog, but there's a reason why she isn't. When we first started training together, I put her directly in front of the sled, and I noticed her cheerful and sweet demeanor quickly went away, and she became very melancholic. I didn't understand what was going on for a while, and Pasha would become too anxious to tell me what was wrong. Then I realized that pulling the weight of the sled reminded her of her days in isolation. I never want her to feel like she's being left out, so I quickly changed her position and placed her as a team dog. Immediately after doing so, her mood changed to her usual bright and shining self. Being surrounded by the other dogs is a reminder that she's part of a team now. And even though she dislikes the wheel position, Pasha always comes through when something happens with the sled during races. I'm glad that we can always count on her to be there for us! She truly is Ilion's biggest sister!"
