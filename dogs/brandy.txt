&emsp;&emsp;Brandy used to be a rescue dog for an isolated monastery in Italy. The beautiful and scenic countryside attracted many tourists in the area, and people would often get lost while hiking. Brandy’s job was to bring them back to the monastery, where they were then free to take refuge until they could leave. Despite being great at his job, he absolutely hated it. Almost every day, he had to deal with lost people and get sweaty and dirty from it all, ruining his gorgeous fur in the process. What’s worse is that the monks wouldn’t groom him; he was left to maintain his good looks and good hygiene on his own. And so, after years of labor, he grew fed up with it all and told the monks of the monastery that he was leaving them to find a new owner. They were saddened by Brandy’s decision but respected it regardless and gave him their full support.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Not long after, Brandy was traveling across Italy in search of the perfect new owner; one that would spoil and pamper him every day! He grew hungry as he made his way into Florence and abruptly stole and ate someone’s food at an outdoor café. Any other person would’ve gotten upset at this, but lucky for Brandy, it happened to be the ever-tolerant musher of Ilion. They were charmed and offered Brandy the rest of their food, soon noticing that he had no tag/collar. They learned that Brandy was searching for a new home, so they offered to adopt him. Brandy was thrilled, and soon enough, finally got to live out his pampered life at the Ilion sanctuary.<br>&emsp;&emsp;He eventually began to miss the monastery, feeling a bit bored from the overindulgence—at least finding lost tourists kept him busy. To keep himself from dying of boredom, he began to branch out and interact with the other sanctuary dogs and eventually found out about Ilion’s sled team. At first, the idea of running long trails and getting sweaty made him shiver. He didn’t want to do physical labor, but he was so bored that he decided to give it a try. He quickly came to love it! And the best part of it is that now, after a long day of training, the musher will brush his fur and give him lots of praise. He’s practically living the dream now.

&emsp;&emsp;"I'll admit and say that I knew next to nothing about dog grooming outside of the basics until I met Brandy. He refused the generic dog shampoo and conditioner that I had, and I ended up falling down a rabbit hole after that. I took a class on dog grooming and bought a bunch of luxury products that a lot of the other dogs ended up loving too. For a while, I thought I was transitioning from being a musher to a dog show competitor; I was that serious about making Brandy’s pampered dreams come true. I think he saw how hard I was working for him, and in return, his performance on the team improved significantly. Due to his stature, I was going to put him on my sprint/mid-distance team, but he has shown to have some of the strongest endurance and listening skills. He rarely misses a turn on the trail, and he’s able to go for long distances without breaking a sweat. However, there are times he’ll pretend to be too tired to go on. I know he does this on purpose to get me to praise him, but that’s fine—I don’t mind praising him for the rest of eternity because he always does a great job, and I would still praise him even if he wasn’t pretending!"
