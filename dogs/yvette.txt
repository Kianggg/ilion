&emsp;&emsp;Yvette was the beloved family pet of an elderly French couple that ran a skiing business in Chamonix, France. Even though the monsieur and mademoiselle were always busy tending to their work, they made it a solid effort to keep Yvette by their side. In his youth, the monsieur would compete in mushing races in Alaska and decided to keep his love for it alive with Yvette, traveling three times a year there to race. Despite not being a resident of Alaska at the time, Yvette remained popular amongst the crowds and other teams—and while she might've seemed aloof and quiet, she always remembered everyone she met and would respectfully greet them back.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Before another trip to Alaska, her owners got into a tragic accident on their way back home from a night out. The monsieur was left in critical condition and passed away shortly after. Thankfully the mademoiselle lived but she was never the same after losing her husband; unfit to care for Yvette or their business, she was placed into a home. Yvette was devastated and heartbroken, unwilling to leave the empty home even after animal rescue workers came by to pick her up. Fortunately for Yvette, the owner's son came by to check on her and take over the family business. During his stay, he found his father's will, which stated for Yvette to be left in the care of the Ilion sanctuary in Alaska. Yvette was familiar with the team, as she had competed against them a few times, and she remembered the musher distinctly as her owners had taken a liking to them. She was reluctant at first but wanted to honor the monsieur's wishes.<br>&emsp;&emsp;With the son's help, Yvette was able to travel safely to the sanctuary and was welcomed with open arms. However, Yvette's ability as a sled dog was put to the test—Even though she did seasonal racing and could endure the harsh winter weather, she wasn't used to the Ilion teams' rigorous training. She made many mistakes in the beginning and questioned her abilities constantly. But no matter how many mistakes she made, she never gave up. With the help of her new musher, friends, and ever-lasting patient nature, she improved in hopes of making her former owners proud.

&#x1F43E She brought over some keepsakes from France inside a small wooden box, and often spends time alone to reminisce about the old days. Inside the wooden box is a photo of her with her former owner, an old shawl that she used to sleep on, and a small plush bear.<br>&#x1F43E She was used as the mascot of her owner’s ski resort; their merchandise was especially popular with children. <br>&#x1F43E She loves having her face petted, and is very affectionate when her ears are rubbed. However, she gets embarrassed over how cuddly she gets, and ends up feeling guilty about wanting to be pet.
&emsp;&emsp;"I was really close to Yvette's owners, and they reminded me so much of my grandparents. It always felt like home back in Kotzebue whenever we spent time together. So the news of what happened was especially devastating, and I was at a loss for words when I found out that I was entrusted with caring for Yvette. I did my best to make her feel welcomed when she arrived, but she had difficulty adjusting. I believed she was still deep in thought about everything, so I felt guilty about placing her on the team so quickly as she would constantly get distracted by her surroundings. One day I took her aside and told her that if she wanted time to herself until she was ready, I would completely understand. At first, she was reluctant to say anything in response, as she’s pretty shy. But then she surprised me by wholeheartedly telling me that she didn’t want to be alone and that being around all of us made her remember all of the good memories she had in Alaska with her owners. So she wanted to work as hard as she could to honor their memory to the fullest. I always try my best to stay calm and collected around my dogs, but I was moved to tears when she told me that. From that moment, my determination in helping her train ignited! It wasn’t easy getting to where we are today, as seasonal sled dogs can fall out of practice very fast, but Yvette consistently gave it her all and eventually landed a spot on my long-distance team. I’m very proud of her for being so resilient and strong, and I know her owners would be too!"
