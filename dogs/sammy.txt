&emsp;&emsp; Sammy is a gentle-natured sled dog who comes from a remote area in Siberia. She wasn't very diligent, but she loved to run and worked hard during her studies to become a sled dog. Before she was able to debut in her first race, her musher decided to retire and she was given to the Ilion musher. Her original musher spoke highly of her talent and strength, and believed that Ilion's musher would help her future growth and potential. Now she resides in Alaska at the sanctuary where she finally gets to train and race in competitions!

&#x1F43E She's a big eater. Raw deer meat is her favorite food, and she gets disappointed whenever it's not being served for dinner.
&emsp;&emsp;"I was surprised when Sammy's original musher suddenly retired. They were well-known in the mushing community and trained many prominent sled dogs in the past decade. I'm honored that he believed I could help Sammy grow stronger, but I think Sammy did most of the work herself! She's very hardworking and reliable; you never have to ask her twice to do anything! She can be a bit shy at times though, hiding whenever she makes a mistake during training. She always comes back, but she's gone for hours at a time, and it can be worrisome. Sometimes I have to send the other dogs out to find her before it gets too dark outside. I told her that she never makes me upset or disappointed, so she doesn't have to hide. She's been getting better about it recently, but bad habits are hard to break. Asides from being a talented wheel dog, she's also very skilled at building snowmen! Whenever it snows, a bunch of snowmen will appear around the sanctuary. The other dogs love to knock them down, but that never stops her from building more!"
