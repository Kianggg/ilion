Olivier
NAME: Olivier<br>BREED: Alaskan malamute<br>FROM: Denali, Alaska<br>POSITION: Wheel<br>TEAM: Long-distance<br>ARTIST: Tazumar<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Olivier is an Alaskan Malamute bred in a small town near Denali, Alaska. She was adopted by a French-Canadian CEO, who brought her back to Montreal as a gift to his wife. He was rarely home, so he took Olivier in hopes that she would keep his wife company. However, the excitement of having a new dog quickly wore off, and she became bored of Olivier and often neglected her because of it. Without a true pack leader to train her, Olivier became disobedient and feisty, destroying furniture and ignoring commands. The larger she grew, the harder she was to control, and the wife became frightful. She soon decided that Olivier wasn’t worth the hassle and surrendered her to a local shelter.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This made Olivier distrustful of humans and possessing a strangely aloof nature for a Malamute; it made it hard for her keepers to find someone who would adopt her. Otherwise, she got along very well with the other shelter dogs, finding them much more friendly and intelligent than any human. One day, the Ilion Musher passed through Montreal and caught sight of a shelter volunteer walking Olivier. She was being incredibly disobedient, dragging the volunteer—a full-grown man—across the path. Rather than helping the volunteer, the musher was impressed with Olivier’s strength and excitedly praised her for it. They asked the volunteer about her and learned that she was up for adoption at the local shelter.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The musher took the chance and adopted her right away, recruiting her onto their mushing team. At first, Olivier was defiant towards the musher, but they didn't give up on her, making sure to give her the guidance and attention she had never received as a puppy. With time, she began to love being part of the team and came to find trust in the musher, soon finally accepting them as her pack leader.

&#x1F43E One of the tallest dogs at the sanctuary (6'4")<br>&#x1F43E She's very tomboyish and loves rough housing and wrestling with the other dogs. Sometimes she'll sit on the smaller dogs that are causing problems because she knows they can't do anything about it.<br>&#x1F43E  She dislikes real fighting between any of the dogs, and will be quick to break it up<br>&#x1F43E Even though she trusts the musher, she is still very wary of other humans who are on sanctuary grounds (even volunteers/workers). She'll end up intimidating them to leave, to which the musher has to step in and tell her to stop.<br>&#x1F43E Tug-O-War is her favorite activity; she always wins!<br>&#x1F43E  She loves chewing on stuff, especially moose bones and furniture.
&emsp;&emsp;"Training Olivier was super tough. She was very stubborn, and her strength is uncontested. But even after the multiple injuries I've sustained, I never gave up on her. She had a great distrust of humans when I brought her to the sanctuary, and so I worked hard to show her that I was trustworthy. "Even if other humans in the world let you down, I won't!" That's what I kept telling her—I know, super corny. It annoyed her too, but I was serious! I tried so many different things that I can't remember what made her smile at me for the first time. Alaska can be gloomy for days on end, but I swear the sun shined on her when she finally started to trust me. I'd take the beatings all over to see that first smile again! I almost considered her for lead dog with how well she listens to me now! But... When we tried it out during training, she was so strong she ended up dragging everyone across the dirt trail. Thankfully, she's happy with being a wheel dog. It's where she gets to show off her true strength!"
