&emsp;&emsp;While the musher was on a brief vacation in Sapporo, Hokkaido, their friend invited them to snowboard. During the snowboarding trip, the musher's friend had invited somebody else to come along. After getting acquainted, the musher soon learned that the newly befriended stranger was a sled dog breeder. Mushing is not popular in Japan, but interest increased in recent years for Japanese mushers who sought to race abroad; with that came a steadily growing demand for well-trained sled dogs.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Soon after their snowboarding trip, the breeder invited Ilion's musher to their home so that they could take a look at their dogs. The musher was pleased to see all of the different kinds of pups having fun and happily running around. A huskita named Maya took an interest in the musher and followed them around the yard. The breeder joked about the musher adopting Maya and placing her on the Ilion team, but despite enjoying Maya's company, they weren't interested in adopting a dog.&emsp;&emsp;<br>But by the time the visit came to an end, the musher was incredibly attached to her. The breeder took notice and decided to gift Maya to them, to which they happily accepted. Maya was super excited to be picked by the musher and ultimately loved her new home in Alaska. The musher didn't push the obligation to join the sled team on Maya since she was still so young, allowing her to choose what she'd like to do as she grew. But Maya wanted to be more than just a pet and was adamant about becoming a sled dog; she was born to be one after all!

&#x1F43E She's popular with female fans<br>&#x1F43E She loves high energy music such as rock n' roll, bubble gum pop, and denpa<br>&#x1F43E She's pretty competitive, so she'll always try to start small competitions with the other dogs such as tug-o-war or quick dashes
&emsp;&emsp;"I normally don't like adopting dogs directly from breeders, but Maya is one of the few exceptions as she was a gift. I also don't raise dogs from puppyhood very often, so it was a fun experience for the most part. Though, when we arrived in Alaska, she was like a tornado for a while, destroying and biting everything she got her paws on. But that behavior quickly dissipated as she grew, and her natural sled dog instincts began to kick in. Because of our bond, she's always loyal and highly dependable! This would usually make a dog a lead candidate, and there are still some days where I think about placing her as one. But she seems to prefer listening to the other lead dogs a lot more than leading everyone herself, which is completely fine! Maya has told me she wants to visit Japan again, and while mushing is growing in popularity there, no big competitions are being hosted at this time (mostly just sled dog tours). Otherwise, I'd love to take her there! But with our tight schedule, there's no way I can find time to visit Japan with all of my dogs. But the second I hear about a competition being hosted there, I'll book us a spot!"
