                    <strong>Paris ~ Ilion's Dog Groomer</strong><br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Although Paris is the younger sister of our Sanctuary's Musher, Hector, she spent much of her life on the coast of Southern France with close family friends. Her early life was relatively peaceful and stress-free, but in the pursuit of more sophisticated education, she left for Arles to board at a prestigious all-girls academy. She learned many subjects at an enriched learning pace. While she did enjoy it, at the end of it all she was left feeling daunted– thoughts about her future left her nothing short of anxious. As a result, she spent her daily life following her graduation feeling aimless until a series of fateful events led her to become interested in dog grooming. The various methods and vast variety of styles piqued her interest greatly.
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Paris began to study the art of dog grooming, and began to enter competitions. In no time, she had started to take home medals. It was a fulfilling thing to do for her, and she came to understand that it was her life’s calling to make every dog as beautiful as can be! As she continued to rise in popularity within the world of dog shows and competitive grooming,  Ilion Sanctuary was also beginning to shine on the other side of the globe alongside her. She had learned about the Sanctuary’s notoriety as an altruistic and competitive organization. Though it wasn’t an easy move and difficult to adjust to her new Alaskan home, Paris reunited with our Musher where she decided to start her very own salon. It wasn’t as glitzy or glamorous as the dog show world, but it was something that she found to be incredibly fulfilling. These days, she has become quite interested in dog mushing, all thanks to the influence of Ilion.
