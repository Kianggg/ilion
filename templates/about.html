                        The Ilion musher made it their mission to give rescued sled dogs a place to call their own. Bringing home dogs from all over the world, the sled team was started as a way to give these dogs a chance to continue their passion in pulling. But the sanctuary isn't just home to veteran sled dogs- as many of the resident dogs have never had prior experience in pulling or racing. But that never stops them from giving it a try and falling in love with the sport; feeling a sense of fulfillment in being able to participate in a team with their newfound friends. The dogs always have a choice in whether they want to participate or not, as their well-being is top priority. As the team continues to grow, so does its popularity. The two Ilion teams (long-distance and sprint/mid-distance) have attracted fans across the globe. This has allowed the team to expand on its training itinerary. But no matter how popular Ilion gets, the musher continues to ensure the comfort and safety of the dogs.
