            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Hello everyone, thank you for taking a look at Ilion's new website! The new site has been almost 2 years in the making. I started drawing the dog page thumbnails back in November of 2022. Originally it was going to be released in 2023, but there have been many delays. Balancing work, other projects, and just being tired amongst a plethora of other things caused me to work so slowly…But I'd rather work slowly and carefully than to put out a rushed product! I think I can safely say now that I am very happy with everything and am very excited for everyone to see! 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Also I want to thank my amazing friend Kiang for doing the coding and for bearing all of my countless instructions and changes. He's been incredible to work with as always! Thank you from the bottom of my heart for working with me, Kiang! By the way, the two of us often work together on games and such~ So keep an eye out for our future projects together! 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Also, another big thank you to Aoneko-san for designing the website layout! They followed my ideas and instructions perfectly and created something so amazing for Ilion! I'm still amazed at how Kiang was able to put together Aoneko-san's work into a functioning website, exactly as it looks from the examples drafted up! Thank you so much! 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;And of course, thank you to all my friends who have contributed dogs, artwork, characters, and other assets! The world of Ilion wouldn't be what it is today without all of you! And lastly, thank you to my editors and beta testers for spotting errors and such that I missed! You guys have helped greatly in contributing to the website's function! 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Seriously, thank you everyone. I know the site is not perfect across all devices, especially mobile, but I'd like to continuously update this site from time to time with Kiang so that the world of Ilion can stay alive! There's many characters and dogs that I've created since I first started the project, and I really want to introduce everyone~ So please look forward to our future updates!!

            &emsp;&emsp;I started working on this website in Fall 2022, and I built it from scratch, like literally a blank file folder. I've learned a lot of web development techniques since then, and while I am very happy with how the Ilion site came out in the end, there's a lot I would do differently if I were to create another website.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;That's a good thing, though—it means that I seriously levelled up my skills. If you really try to break the site, you'll find a bunch of jank. But, everything is there for a reason—it was a welcome challenge to perfectly recreate the diagrams of Roby and Aoneko-san, which were often incredibly specific and required creative workarounds. But, as you can see, they look AWESOME and I wouldn't have it any other way.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Roby really went and coordinated with 30+ other artists for all of the dogs on the site, which is seriously incredible. Me, I have trouble scheduling a 5-person D&D night. I'd like to give my congrats and thanks to everyone who worked to put this art project together!
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;It is my earnest hope that everyone can enjoy the wonderful, creative world of Ilion.
