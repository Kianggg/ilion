					<strong>Ilion's Nanny Dog</strong><br>
                    <strong>Breed:</strong> Anatolian Shepherd<br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Meryem was once a herding dog in Rize, Turkey, and would help her owner shepherd sheep and goats. Having been trained exceptionally well, she had a second sense for finding any of the livestock with just her nose—she was especially protective of the lambs and kid goats. However, a few years ago, she injured her leg on the job and wasn’t able to work as well as she used to. As a result, her owner had to retire her, adopting a new herding dog to take her place. Meryem’s injury has completely healed now, but her veterinarian recommended against letting her herd again, as she can’t overexert herself lest she possibly reinjure her leg to the point where it becomes irreparable.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Although her new retired life was cushiony and stress-free, she was yearning to feel depended on again. Her owner saw how depressed she had become, and sought out the Ilion musher for their assistance—and just their luck! The Sanctuary, wanting to give back to the town of Diogenes, was in the process of starting a daycare program for the town and its residents. It was the perfect fit for Meryem!
