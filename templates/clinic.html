                &emsp;&emsp;Down the path through the entrance gates you'll find where the story of Ilion all began. Before our sanctuary grew to what it is today, our humble clinic was all that occupied these grounds. It is a symbol of our desire for animal welfare: a place of warmth, kindness, and healing. Our team is composed of professionally trained veterinarians and assistants, experienced with animals of all kinds.<br>&emsp;&emsp;We offer routine check ups, diagnostics, vaccinations, dental services, microchipping, minor surgeries, and more. Please note that we are not an emergency hospital; however, our staff is well-trained in critical care and triage. We are open for the majority of the year sans major holidays, and walk-ins are permitted.

                        <br><br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;Originally from Sitka, Polina is the second in command here at Ilion, and often takes over the clinic when Hector is out training and racing the team. The two have been close friends since studying veterinary medicine together during university in Fairbanks.
                        <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;From diagnosing illnesses, providing physical exams, and determining medications—Polina is an incredibly diligent and reputable veterinarian who, despite her cold demeanor, cares deeply about the well-being of her animal patients.
                        <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;Her dog Suya, who she’s training to become a certified ESA, can be seen following her around the office.

                        &emsp;&emsp;Hailing all the way from Philadelphia, Dani moved to Alaska with an interest in arctic and glacier worms. Her life's work is making sure that all patients and animals in the sanctuary are safe and healthy from any potential parasites and bacteria!
                        <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;Aside from making sure everyone is parasite-free; Dani provides assistance to our veterinarians with exams, medications, and will occasionally oversee appointments when days get busy. On her days off she loves to travel outside of Diogenes to nearby glaciers to study more about the worms, bringing them back for the dogs and staff to see, describing them with a fascinated glee.

                        &emsp;&emsp;From a young age Honami has loved marine biology and dreamt of working at the marine center near the Sea of Okhotsk in Hokkaido. Being born into a military family, however, led to her moving too far and too often to settle in one place.
                        <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;But her love for animals prevailed, and after finishing university with a degree in animal health and marine biology, she eventually found her way to Diogenes–where she fell in love with the town and its surroundings, making it her new home. Honami single-handedly takes care of the Ilion clinic’s reception work, sometimes also personally assisting the vets.
