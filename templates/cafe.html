                    Are you a big fan of coffee and sweets? Being a fairly new addition to the sanctuary, our cafe has already captured the hearts of both our guests and our dogs! With an ever-changing and trendy menu, using only fresh ingredients supplied locally by the wonderful residents of Diogenes, all of our pastries and coffee are made fresh in house with plenty of love~ Here, you'll also find Ilion merchandise, all of which goes directly to supporting the sanctuary and our team! With how often our sled dogs come here to relax, there might be a chance you meet one of your favorite team members here as well!
