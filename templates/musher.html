                    <p style="font-size: 19px;">&emsp;&emsp;Born and raised in Kotzebue, Alaska, Hector hailed from a family of veterinarians. Dogs were a regular part of their life. During the winter months, their parents would work as checkpoint veterinarians for various sled dog races. Hector would often be allowed to tag along, holding a deep interest and admiration for their parents’ hard work.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Their own desire to help dogs influenced them to take on the same trade that was running in their family for generations. After graduating, they sat on the idea of starting their very own practice, or continuing their family’s. They decided they wanted to open their own and settled upon starting it up in Diogenes, a small but welcoming town. Operations were small in the beginning, and so Hector began volunteering at different competitions across Alaska in order to gain more experience with dogs.<br>&emsp;&emsp;While the wellbeing of each dog in order to perform their best was their main focus in terms of their practice, their feelings on veterinary work changed completely when they volunteered at the Iditarod one year– the biggest sled dog competition in the world. There, they saw the drive and passion that each dog had for racing like never before. It ignited the flame of inspiration that made them want to become a musher.<br>&emsp;&emsp;After the race, they decided to start their own team. Traveling all around Alaska and the globe, Hector sought out dogs for their team– but as time went on, their mission to start a team evolved into wanting to help and rescue sled dogs and to provide a new home for them. The Ilion clinic and kennel grew and became the sanctuary we know today for these dogs. Now, presently, the Ilion team is composed of some of the most unique sled dogs you’ll ever meet, coming from around the world and all walks of life. Hector wouldn’t have it any other way! <br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
