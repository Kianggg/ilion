                    <p style="font-size: 19px;">&emsp;&emsp;Born and raised in Kotzebue, Alaska, Hector hailed from a family of veterinarians. During the winter months, their parents would work as checkpoint veterinarians for various sled dog races. Hector would often be allowed to tag along, holding a deep interest and admiration for their parents’ hard work. Their own desire to help dogs influenced them to take on the same trade that was running in their family for generations.<br>&emsp;&emsp;After graduating from university, they sat on the idea of starting their very own practice, or continuing their family’s. They decided they wanted to open their own—choosing Diogenes, a small but welcoming town, as the location for their clinic. Operations were small in the beginning, and so Hector began volunteering at different sled dog competitions across Alaska in order to gain more experience with dogs.<br>&emsp;&emsp;While they enjoyed working at their practice and volunteering, their feelings on their career shifted one year when they volunteered at the Iditarod—the biggest sled dog competition in the world. There, they saw the drive and passion that each dog had for racing like never before. It ignited the flame of inspiration that made them want to become a musher.<br>&emsp;&emsp;After the race, Hector set out to start their own team–traveling all around Alaska and the world. But as time went on, their journey to start a team evolved into wanting to help and rescue sled dogs and to provide a new home for them. The Ilion clinic and kennel grew and became the sanctuary we know today for these dogs. Now, currently, the Ilion team is composed of some of the most unique sled dogs you’ll ever meet, and Hector wouldn’t have it any other way; treasuring each one with all their heart! <br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
